<h1><a name="skip_menu"></a>EAD DTD Version 2002</h1>

<hr>
<p>This page contains instructions for downloading Version 2002 of the Document Type
Definition (DTD) for the Encoded Archival Description, an implementation of ISO 8879, SGML
(Standard Generalized Markup Language)/XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  Version 2002
of the EAD DTD was finalized in December 2002.  It supersedes version 1.0, released in
August 1998. It also contains links to related files. The 2002 version
is the second production release of the EAD DTD.  It incorporates a
small number of newly-defined elements, deprecates eight previously used elements, and
modifies the structure (content model) for a few elements to allow the inclusion of other valid
EAD elements at different levels within a finding aid.  The changes and additions were
suggested as a result of experience with the first (1998) production release of the 
test version of the EAD DTD. During the four years that Version 1.0 was in use, hundreds of
archives experimented with use of the EAD DTD for a range of
finding aid encoding projects. Their input was important for
deciding upon which changes and additions were essencial in the 2002 release.</p>

<p>Version 2002 of the EAD DTD is designed to function as both an SGML and XML DTD.
It conforms to all SGML/XML (ISO 8879) specifications. It has been
thoroughly tested using a wide variety of existing SGML/XML software. To be used as an XML
DTD, "switches" have been included in the DTD for turning off features used only in SGML
applications, and turning on features used in XML applications. Instructions for using
these "switches" are contained in the DTD itself. Please keep in mind, downloading
the EAD DTD and related files is <i>not</i> all you will need to do to
begin using it.  Most SGML and XML authoring software requires more than
simply loading a new DTD to make them work since there are often
proprietary features and add-ons to contend with.  You will most likely
need to consult manuals or user guides on your SGML/XML software after
getting a copy of the EAD DTD and related files themselves.</p>

<p>Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), as applied in this DTD
and related files, has revolutionized the world of finding
aids by providing a single standardized encoding through which archival
descriptions can be exchanged and used. It may also simplify the process of
creating machine-readable finding aids in the future as the use of XML
tools becomes more widespread and better understood.</p>

<p>As you begin to implement this version of the EAD DTD, keep in mind that it
is the product of a lengthy development effort during which many options and
models were considered.  It may not reflect the exact structure of the finding
aids that you currently produce, but it should provide elements into which you
can fit the information you currently capture.</p>
<p>The EAD DTD was designed to be somewhat prescriptive, providing and in some
cases requiring that finding aids be structured in a particular way.  This will
occasionally result in differences between the structure of an encoded archival
description and existing printed finding aids when they are used as the source
for content.</p>
<h2><a name="whattodo"></a>What You Need To Do:</h2>
<p>To start creating your own Encoded Archival Descriptions, you will need various
files and support documents.  Most are available to you electronically via
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) from an anonymous file server.  The EAD Tag Library is currently available as both a print and <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/ead/tglib/index.html">Web
 version</a>. Due to the length of the EAD Tag Library, we recommend you purchase a copy of the printed document which is available from the <a
href="http://www.archivists.org/catalog/pubDetail.asp?objectID=235">Society of
American
Archivists</a>.
  It should greatly facilitate your use of the EAD DTD.
  
  <p><strong>The entire suite of files  can be downloaded as a
      self-extracting
compressed ("zip") file</strong>.  Once transferred, run the file from Windows
to extract
the components
onto your hard drive.</p>
  <p>COMPRESSED FILE:
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.loc.gov/pub/ead/ead2002.exe">ead2002.exe</a> (self-extracting
  archive)</li>
</ul><i>or</i>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/ead/ead2002.zip">ead2002.zip</a> (zip file)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Alternately, you can  FTP download the EAD DTD and other machine-readable
  documents. All you need is access to the Internet and electronic transfer
  software (FTP).
  The host domain
of LC's FTP server is: ftp.loc.gov</p>
<ol>Once an FTP session is initiated, you will be prompted for a name.  You
should enter:
<li>anonymous
<li>When you are prompted for a password, enter your Internet address, or name.
<li>At the FTP> prompt, change to the EAD subdirectory by entering the command:
<li>cd pub/ead
<br>NOTE: The character between the subdirectory names is a forward slash!
<li>Entering the command "dir" will return to you a list of the files available
in the EAD subdirectory.
</ol>
<p>The files you should transfer using the "get" command are listed below. The
"get" command should copy a file to the default directory on the machine you are
using locally.  Most of the files should be transferred as ASCII files, which is
the default transfer mode for most FTP applications.  Some of these files will need to be
transferred
in BINARY mode.  To change to binary mode during an FTP session, enter the
command "bin".  The command "asc" can be used to return to ASCII mode.  NOTE: For
some FTP applications, the transfer mode is automatically set based on the file
extension found during transfer.</p>
<p>Additionally the following files can be downloaded from Internet Explorer
  or Mozilla by right-clicking on the link and selecting "Save Target As," or
  in Netscape by holding the "shift" key and clicking on the link.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to FTP or are not able to download the files, you may request a diskette containing these
files by contacting the Library of Congress, <a href=
"http://lcnetdev.github.io/marc/ndmso.html">Network Development and MARC
Standards Office (NDMSO)</a>, who will be acting as the maintenance agency for this
standard. </p>
<p>We encourage you to join the large number of users of the EAD DTD if you are
not already among that growing group.  We also look
forward to getting feedback from you as you make use of Encoded Archival Description for the first
time.  The EAD DTD is not set in stone but will be enhanced in the future based
on the experiences of its users.  If you know of anyone else interested
in this effort, encourage them to download the above EAD DTD files and subscribe to the <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/ead/eadlist.html">EAD
electronic forum</a>.</p>
