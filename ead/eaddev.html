      <h1><a name="skip_menu" id="skip_menu"></a>Development of the Encoded Archival
        Description DTD</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <P>This paper presents general background information and a status report
        on the development of the Encoded Archival Description Document Type
        Definition (EAD DTD).</P>
      <h3>Choosing an Encoding Standard</h3>
      <P>Development of the EAD DTD began with a project initiated by the University
        of California, Berkeley, Library in 1993. The goal of the Berkeley project
        was to investigate the desirability and feasibility of developing a nonproprietary
        encoding standard for machine-readable finding aids such as inventories,
        registers, indexes, and other documents created by archives, libraries,
        museums, and manuscript repositories to support the use of their holdings.
        The project directors recognized the growing role of networks in accessing
        information about holdings, and they were keen to include information
        beyond that which was provided by traditional machine-readable cataloging
        (MARC) records. The development of the EAD DTD was a cooperative venture
        from early on, with specialists at Berkeley working in consultation with
        experts at other institutions. Daniel Pitti, the principal investigator
        for the Berkeley Project, developed requirements for the encoding standard
        which included the following criteria: 1) ability to present extensive
        and interrelated descriptive information found in archival finding aids,
        2) ability to preserve the hierarchical relationships existing between
        levels of description, 3) ability to represent descriptive information
        that is inherited by one hierarchical level from another, 4) ability
        to move within a hierarchical informational structure, and 5) support
        for element-specific indexing and retrieval.</P>
      <P>At the start of the project, candidates for meeting the requirements
        for a standard encoding technique included Gopher presentation of flat
        (i.e., unmarked) ASCII text, ASCII text marked up using HTML (HyperText
        Markup Language) tags, MARC tagging using either existing or new implementations
        of the MARC (Z39.2/ISO 2709) records structure, and markup conformant
        to SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language, ISO 8879). SGML emerged
        from the analysis as being a technique able to meet all of the functional
        requirements as well as one supported by a large and growing number of
        software products available for a variety of operating systems. Pitti
        and his colleagues at Berkeley chose to experiment with the use of SGML
        in encoding a variety of archival finding aids from Berkeley and other
        institutions.</P>
      <h3>Application of SGML</h3>
      <P>Standard Generalized Markup Language was chosen over other possible
        solutions because of certain characteristics it possesses. SGML is a
        set of rules for defining and expressing the logical structure of documents
        thereby enabling software products to control the searching, retrieval,
        and structured display of those documents. The rules are applied in the
        form of markup (tags) that can be embedded in an electronic document
        to identify and establish relationships among structural parts. Because
        consistent markup of similarly structured documents is key to successful
        electronic processing of them, SGML encourages consistency by introducing
        the concept of a document type definition (or DTD). A DTD prescribes
        the ordered set of SGML markup tags available for encoding the parts
        of documents in a similar class. Archival finding aids, which share similar
        parts and structure, form a class of documents for which a DTD could
        be and was developed.</P>
      <P>Pitti began development of the finding aids DTD by analyzing numerous
        examples forwarded to Berkeley by archivists who had responded to requests
        for cooperation. He found the greatest similarities in structure among
        those finding aids commonly referred to as inventories and registers.
        The structural similarities between finding aids helped to construct
        the model that was the basis of his draft finding aid DTD.</P>
      <P>The March 1995 version of the Berkeley Finding Aid Project (BFAP) DTD,
        also known as the FINDAID DTD, defined a class of documents that, in
        general, consisted of an optional title page, the description of a unit
        of archival material, and optional back matter. A title page conforming
        to the draft DTD could include a number of elements, such as the identification
        of the repository or type of finding aid. A unit description conforming
        to the DTD could include a brief description of the unit (incorporating
        taggable elements analogous to those of a MARC catalog record), a longer
        narrative description of the unit and any segregable parts (including
        such taggable elements as title, dates, and scope and content), and formatted
        container lists.</P>
      <P>As the original Berkeley DTD took shape, it was tested by encoding finding
        aids and then manipulating them electronically. By March 1995, a critical
        mass of encoding had been achieved, and the results (involving nearly
        two hundred finding aids from fifteen repositories) were shared with
        a group of fifty archivists and manuscript librarians. The participants
        in this initial test were invited to attend a three-day Finding Aids
        Conference (April 4-6, 1995) jointly sponsored by the Library of the
        University of California, Berkeley, and the Commission on Preservation
        and Access. Conference attendees observed that the SGML encoding of finding
        aids accessed locally or online via networks could simplify, improve,
        and expand access to archival collections by making it possible to link
        catalog records to finding aids. It also enabled searching among pools
        of networked finding aids and keyword access to locate folders or items
        previously buried in container lists. Attendees encouraged Pitti to pursue
        adoption of the approach as a standard by the archival profession.</P>
      <h3>Bentley Fellowship, July 1995</h3>
      <P>Hoping to strengthen the case for adoption by the archival community
        of an SGML-based encoding standard, Pitti sought the assistance of a
        team of experts in archival descriptive standards augmented by an expert
        in SGML encoding techniques, who agreed to critique and refine the BFAP
        approach. Members of the team whom Pitti assembled to analyze and evaluate
        the Berkeley work were Steven J. DeRose (Inso, Inc.; formerly Electronic
        Book Technologies), Jackie M. Dooley (University of California, Irvine),
        Michael J. Fox (Minnesota Historical Society), Steven L. Hensen (Duke
        University), Kris Kiesling (Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center),
        Janice E. Ruth (Library of Congress), Sharon Gibbs Thibodeau (National
        Archives and Records Administration), and Helena Zinkham (Library of
        Congress). Under the auspices of the Bentley Library Research Fellowship
        Program for the Study of Modern Archives, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
        Foundation, the Division of Preservation and Access of the National Endowment
        for the Humanities, and the Bentley Historical Library, the Pitti-led
        team gathered for a week-long meeting (July 22-29, 1995) in Ann Arbor,
        Michigan. At this meeting, the group (later known as the Bentley team)
        agreed to collaborate in the production of 1) finding aid encoding standard
        design principles; 2) a revised finding aid data model; 3) a revised
        finding aid document type definition; 4) finding aid encoding guidelines
        and examples; and 5) an article describing the team's understanding of
        the structure and content of finding aids.</P>
      <P>The Bentley team reached early agreement on the principles that would
        underlie their design of an encoding standard. With these principles
        in mind (originally designated the Ann Arbor Accords), the group proceeded
        to review the structure of the document to be encoded. They agreed that
        at the most basic level, a finding aid document consists of two segments:
        a segment that provides information about the finding aid itself (its
        title, compiler, compilation date) and a segment that provides information
        about a body of archival material (a collection, a record group, or a
        series). Following the example of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),
        the group designated the segment about the finding aid itself as the "header." Within
        the segment providing information about the described material (the actual
        finding aid), two types of information could be presented: 1) hierarchically
        organized information that describes a unit of records or papers along
        with its component parts or divisions and 2) adjunct information that
        may not directly describe records or papers but that facilitates their
        use by researchers (e.g, a bibliography). The hierarchy of descriptive
        information, reflecting archival principles of arrangement, generally
        begins with a summary of the whole and proceeds to delineation of the
        parts as a set of contextual views. Descriptions of the parts inherit
        information from descriptions of the whole.</P>
      <P>Agreement on this overall structure enabled the developers to evaluate
        the encoded elements that had been incorporated in the BFAP model. Those
        elements that survived the evaluation process formed two categories:
        elements that would be tagged at specific, predictable points in the
        description of units or component parts (descriptive elements) and those
        elements that could be tagged anywhere within the document (generic elements).
        Generic elements usually are embedded within a descriptive element. The
        group agreed that when elements had a close analog in the TEI guidelines,
        the element name and, when appropriate the element content model, should
        be taken from the TEI guidelines.</P>
      <P>A characteristic of SGML is the possibility of defining attributes and
        associating them with particular elements. The developers of the EAD
        concluded that the finding aid DTD should take full advantage of this
        possibility. Attributes could provide options to make an element more
        specific. A small set of basic elements could be expanded through attributes
        in lieu of creating a large set of specific elements. For example, an
        attribute associated with the personal name element can specify the role
        of the person as creator or collector, sender or recipient.</P>
      <P>By combining descriptive and generic elements with attributes in a simplified
        document structure, the Bentley team was able to distill from the BFAP
        model the essential finding aid tag set. Within a few days of the July
        1995 meeting in Michigan, Pitti began to recast the Ann Arbor Accords
        into a revised data model and finding aid DTD. It was at that time that
        the name "Encoded Archival Description", or EAD, was coined. The key
        changes introduced in Ann Arbor were: 1) the separation of information
        about the finding aid into a header; 2) the distinction between the hierarchically
        presented unit description information and adjunct information; and 3)
        the replacement of the BFAP model's collection divisions and materials
        lists with the more open-ended concepts of recursive "component description" and
        a "display group" element to bind pieces of text for display in tabular
        form.</P>
      <P>The group working on the EAD DTD emphasized the importance of documentation,
        such as a tag library and application guidelines, to make the implementation
        of SGML viable. Such documentation needed to be "friendly" enough to
        enable users barely acquainted with SGML to apply the DTD both routinely
        and intermittently in their work. While the group focused on elements
        to ease conversion of traditional finding aids, it also reached for SGML
        techniques that could begin to improve the delivery of register and inventory
        information, particularly in an online environment. The team speculated
        about future possibilities, involving attachment of online "help" scripts
        to explain descriptive practice as reflected in finding aids, links to
        central glossaries and shared administrative histories, and presentation
        of new views that might transform hierarchical data into archival family
        trees.</P>
      <h3>Involvement of the Society of American Archivists</h3>
      <P>Among the topics discussed by the Bentley group were several associated
        with prospects for profession-wide adoption and maintenance of an encoding
        standard for finding aids. Recognizing that successful development of
        the DTD would require the participation of a broad community of archivists
        and archives users, the group planned to circulate widely both the Ann
        Arbor Accords and the revised data model based upon them. The annual
        meeting of the Society of American Archivists, held in late August 1995
        provided an excellent forum for the presentation of concepts and ideas
        relating to EAD. The Society's Committee on Archival Information Exchange
        (CAIE) agreed to assume some responsibility for involving interested
        archivists. The CAIE established an EAD Working Group chaired by Bentley
        team member Kris Kiesling and consisting of all members of the original
        Bentley team (except Steven DeRose) as well as the following additional
        individuals: Randall Barry (Library of Congress Network Development and
        MARC Standards Office), Wendy Duff (University of Toronto), Ricky Erway
        (Research Libraries Group), Anne Gilliland-Swetland (University of California,
        Los Angeles), William E. Landis (University of California, Los Angeles),
        Eric Miller (OCLC Online Computer Library Center), Meg Sweet (Public
        Record Office, United Kingdom), Robert Spindler (Arizona State University),
        and Richard Szary (Yale University). The EAD Working Group accepted responsibility
        for monitoring and supporting the ongoing development of the EAD DTD,
        tag library, and application guidelines. Immediately following its annual
        meeting, the SAA Council agreed to submit a formal request to the Library
        of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office to serve as
        the maintenance agency for the EAD DTD.</P>
      <h3>Prelude to the EAD Alpha Release</h3>
      <P>In mid-October 1995, Daniel Pitti released for review an "early implementors'
        version" of an EAD data model and prototype DTD based on the work accomplished
        in Ann Arbor by the Bentley team. It was distributed to a small group
        for review and testing. Two weeks later, on November 1-3, 1995, a three-day
        meeting to refine the data model and DTD was held in Washington, D.C.,
        under the sponsorship of the Library of Congress National Digital Library
        Program. Participants at this meeting included most of the original Bentley
        team, representatives from several Library of Congress divisions, Anne
        Gilliland-Swetland, and Debbie Lapeyre, an SGML expert with ATLIS Consulting
        Group. Based on decisions made at this meeting, ATLIS Consulting Group,
        under contract to the Library of Congress, began making revisions to
        the DTD. ATLIS also began work on the creation of an EAD tag library,
        a key piece of support documentation for implementors of the new DTD.</P>
      <P>In early December, the Society of American Archivists received funding
        from the Council on Library Resources (later Council on Library and Information
        Resources) to create application guidelines for EAD. To that end, a subset
        of the Bentley team met on January 4-6, 1996, in Los Angeles, California,
        with Anne Gilliland-Swetland and Tom La Porte of Dreamworks SKG, who
        had been hired to write application guidelines for the DTD. The purpose
        of this meeting was to evaluate the ATLIS-revised EAD DTD, review the
        draft tag library, and outline the content of the application guidelines.
        Additional changes needed to EAD were identified and subsequently incorporated
        into what was to become the "alpha" version of the EAD DTD.</P>
      <P>While the alpha version of the EAD DTD and support documentation was
        being finalized, the Library of Congress Network Development and MARC
        Standards Office formally agreed to serve as the maintenance agency for
        the EAD in a letter to Susan Fox, executive director of SAA. As the maintenance
        agency, the Library would make the DTD and support documentation available
        and act as a clearinghouse for communications on EAD, chiefly through
        the establishment of a listserv and World Wide Web site. SAA would be
        responsible for ongoing oversight of the standard.</P>
      <h3>Alpha Release Made Available</h3>
      <P>On February 26, 1996, the prototype EAD DTD was declared ready for release
        to early implementors as an "alpha" version. As with the alpha releases
        of computer software, this version of the EAD DTD was not advertised
        as perfect but was considered good enough to yield valuable results when
        applied to a variety of finding aids in diverse institutions. The alpha
        version DTD and a revised alpha tag library were made available at two
        sites, one at the University of California, Berkeley, and the other at
        the Library of Congress. The ability to obtain copies of the DTD and
        related documentation electronically helped to speed testing and sharing
        of test results.</P>
      <P>Within the first few months of alpha testing, numerous archives and
        libraries marked up selected finding aids. These encoded documents generated
        valuable feedback to the EAD Working Group and strengthened the overall
        belief that the DTD could emerge as a standard for encoded archival descriptions.
        Interest internationally in the development of an SGML implementation
        for finding aids also appeared, particularly in Europe where use of SGML
        has been on the rise. A number of foreign archives and libraries obtained
        copies of the EAD DTD and subscribed to the EAD listserv. A translation
        of an earlier version of this report even appeared in an Italian archival
        journal.</P>
      <h3>Development and Release of the Beta DTD</h3>
      <P>The EAD Working Group originally planned for alpha testing to last approximately
        six months before analyzing feedback and preparing a beta version release
        during the second half of 1996. Work on the beta release started sooner
        than expected, however, when EAD developers convened in Berkeley, California,
        on April 27-29, 1996, for a three-day meeting sponsored by the Council
        on Library Resources and hosted by the University of California, Berkeley.
        The primary purpose for the April 1996 meeting was to provide an opportunity
        for the original Bentley team to meet with Anne Gilliland-Swetland and
        Tom La Porte to review their draft application guidelines and resolve
        problems with the DTD that had surfaced thus far during the alpha testing.
        Joining Gilliland-Swetland, La Porte, and the Bentley team, were Randall
        Barry of the Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards
        Office and Tim Hoyer and Jack Von Euw of the University of California,
        Berkeley. Reaffirmation of basic design principles, identification of
        additional modifications needed to the DTD, and a discussion of the content
        and style of the support documentation dominated the busy three-day meeting.
        The meeting participants also explored for the first time potential designs
        for an EAD logo to be used on printed and Web versions of the planned
        documentation.</P>
      <P>Revisions to the alpha DTD, tag library, and application guidelines
        began immediately after the April 1996 meeting in California, with the
        revised goal of making a beta test version available later that summer.
        In-depth electronic mail discussions among the EAD developers continued
        throughout the spring and early summer, and by mid-June 1996, a draft
        of the beta DTD was completed. This draft version was modified slightly
        after SAA's annual meeting in late August, and a "final" beta version
        DTD became available in mid-September 1996. Several minor typographical
        modifications occurred in late November 1996, resulting in a date change
        to the September EAD files. A beta version tag library appeared in October
        1996, and draft beta version application guidelines followed two months
        later. The EAD Working Group decided that no further changes would be
        made to the beta DTD for at least a year. The files remained stable to
        permit implementation and full testing by EAD Working Group members and
        participating institutions.</P>
      <h3>Beta Workshops, Orientation Sessions, and Outreach Efforts</h3>
      <P>Release of the beta DTD and its documentation greatly increased interest
        in EAD among institutions that had previously worked with the alpha version
        as well as from newcomers with little prior knowledge of the encoding
        standard. The EAD Working Group successfully fostered this interest.
        Kris Kiesling took a six-month leave of absence from her position at
        the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center to advise the Research Libraries
        Group (RLG) on EAD-related issues and to assist RLG in creating a two-day
        workshop to help its member institutions implement the beta DTD. Kiesling
        and co-instructor Michael Fox developed the initial course with contributions
        from Daniel Pitti, Alvin Pollock, and Tim Hoyer at the University of
        California, Berkeley, and input from an advisory panel of early implementors,
        including Lisa Browar (New York Public Library), Steven L. Hensen (Duke
        University), Steven Mandeville-Gamble (Stanford University), Richard
        Szary (Yale University), Richard Masters (British Library) and Susan
        von Salis (Schlesinger Library), who joined Kiesling, Fox, Ricky Erway
        (RLG), and the Berkeley trio for a three-day meeting in Mountain View,
        California, held on May 23-25, 1996. Since the first workshop in July
        1996, Kiesling and Fox have taught more than twenty workshops throughout
        the United States and in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These
        hands-on workshops have introduced more than four hundred archivists,
        librarians, and systems administrators to EAD, first under the aegis
        of RLG and since September 1997 as part of SAA's continuing education
        program.</P>
      <P>Complementing the RLG/SAA workshops were a number of other training
        efforts undertaken by other working group members and early implementors:
        Daniel Pitti has taught three one-week EAD classes at the Rare Books
        School operated by the University of Virginia and three two-day workshops
        at various other institutions in the United States, United Kingdom, and
        Canada; Helena Zinkham, Janice Ruth, Mary Lacy, and Stephen Miller have
        offered half-day and full-day EAD workshops at various regional archives
        conferences; Wendy Duff, Anne Gilliland-Swetland, William Landis, Janice
        Ruth, and others have delivered lectures about EAD as part of graduate
        school courses in archives and library science; and numerous Working
        Group members and implementors have presented papers and talks about
        EAD at regional, national, and international conferences. In addition,
        as more repositories have begun to work with EAD, staff from those institutions
        have developed in-house orientation and training sessions to disseminate
        information about the DTD and to develop internal standards for local
        implementation. Within months of the beta release, Web sites quickly
        emerged to provide access to EAD-encoded finding aids and to share information
        about specific EAD applications and tools with the larger archival community.
        Implementors have also exchanged tips, advice, questions, and suggestions
        via the official EAD listserv maintained by the Library of Congress.</P>
      <h3>Solicitation and Review of Formal Comments</h3>
      <P>On June 23, 1997, nine months after releasing the beta version DTD,
        the EAD Working Group invited the archival community to submit to the
        EAD listserv formal comments and suggestions about changes to the beta
        version DTD. Originally intended to span only three months, the comment
        period was extended until mid-October to allow for fuller experimentation
        and testing of the DTD. Through the generous financial support of the
        Delmas Foundation, the SAA sponsored a three-day meeting, October 31-November
        2, 1997, of the EAD Working Group to review and discuss the changes recommended
        on the listserv by EAD implementors. At this meeting, held in Washington,
        D.C., the EAD Working Group reviewed nearly fifty email messages sent
        from beta testers around the world, including the National Archives of
        Sweden, the British Public Records Office, the Bodleian Library, and
        the Canadian National Archives. The majority of the messages proposed
        potential changes to the DTD based upon experience with the beta version
        or analysis of its relationship to other archival data structures or
        content standards such as MARC, the International Standard for Archival
        Description General (ISAD-G), and the Canadian Rules for Archival Description
        (RAD). The merits of each proposed change were considered individually,
        and group consensus was reached by considering among other factors the
        global applicability of a proposed change, the amount of retrospective
        conversion a desired change would require, and whether other changes
        or existing DTD structures would achieve the same result more effectively.</P>
      <P>The initial decisions made in Washington were compiled and in a few
        instances revisited and revised in the two months following the meeting.
        The Working Group prepared and released on January 30, 1998, two detailed
        email messages to the EAD listserv outlining both the changes that it
        had agreed to incorporate in the next release of the DTD (Version 1.0)
        and the proposals that it had declined to enact. The rationale for each
        decision was provided, and reaction from listserv readers was invited.</P>
      <h3>Preparation and Release of Version 1.0 of the EAD DTD</h3>
      <P>After notifying the archival community of its decisions, the EAD Working
        Group set about the task of modifying the beta version DTD and totally
        revising the existing beta tag library to reflect more accurately the
        proposed Version 1.0 structure. Delays occurred when competing responsibilities
        laid claim to team members' time and when the group decided that postponing
        the release of Version 1.0 might permit greater compatibility with the
        emerging Extensible Markup Language (XML) standard, which was just entering
        the final stages of development. At the Washington meeting in early November,
        the team had decided that if possible, it should make the EAD DTD compliant
        with XML in order to facilitate easier Internet access to SGML-encoded
        finding aids. As a more content-aware language than HTML, XML offers
        the potential for forthcoming versions of Web browsers like Netscape
        and Internet Explorer to display EAD-encoded finding aids in their native
        SGML without requiring helper applications like Panorama. Although parts
        of XML and its related standards XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language)
        and XLL (Extensible Linking Language) still remain unclear, the EAD Working
        Group decided that XML development had reached sufficient stability to
        proceed with releasing Version 1.0 of the EAD DTD at the end of August
        1998 to coincide with the SAA annual meeting, held August 31-September
        6, 1998, in Orlando, Florida.</P>
      <P>Since the Version 1.0 DTD represents significant changes from the previous
        beta version, implementors are encouraged to update their encoded documents
        as quickly as their resources permit. Archivists new to EAD should be
        mindful that institutions will be converting to Version 1.0 at different
        rates and that Web sites, other than the official EAD site at the Library
        of Congress, may contain documentation and finding aid examples that
        reflect superseded beta and alpha versions of the EAD DTD.</P>
      <h3>Availability of Tag Library and Other Documentation</h3>
      <P>Accompanying Version 1.0 of the DTD is a completely revised and updated
        EAD tag library, which was compiled by Working Group members during Spring
        and early Summer 1998. A printed copy of this soft-cover, 262-page publication
        is available for sale from SAA. An online version of the tag library,
        with links to corrections and updated comments, will be mounted on the
        official EAD Web site at the Library of Congress in Fall 1998.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the publication of the tag library and the Version 1.0
        DTD are two special issues of SAA's quarterly journal, <EM>The American
        Archivist</EM>, which are devoted entirely to EAD. The first issue, which
        carries a publication date of Summer 1997, was mailed to SAA members
        in late August 1998 and contains "six papers that explore the context
        within which EAD was developed, the essentials of its structured approach
        to encoding finding aid data, and the role that EAD is meant to play
        in individual repositories and for the profession as a whole." The second
        issue, mailed a week later and identified as Fall 1997, contains six
        case studies on implementing and testing the beta version of the EAD
        DTD. Plans are underway to republish these two special <EM>American Archivist</EM> issues
        as a single hard-cover monograph, which will be marketed to a wider audience
        than SAA members and will be sold at a cost lower than the purchase price
        of two issues of the journal.</P>
      <h3>EAD 2002</h3>
      <P>With the arrival of the new millennium, the need to reconsider some
        existing SGML/XML elements and to examine certain design aspects of the
        EAD DTD had grown to the point where formal suggestions were solicited
        from users of the DTD. A series of 67 suggestions for changes and additions
        were received from users via a web-based suggestions form made public
        on the EAD Web site. The suggestions were consolidated into a list that
        was circulated internally and discussed during a special meeting of the
        EAD Working Group, held in Washington, DC, April 27-29, 2001. The meeting
        included representatives from Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom,
        and the United States--bearing witness to the international importance
        of this emerging standard.</P>
      <P>The discussions resulted in the deprecation of only eight (8) EAD elements
        that had been part of the Version 1.0 (1998) EAD DTD. Much of the need
        to deprecate elements at all was due to a desire to keep the EAD DTD
        compatible with provisions of the General International Standard Archival
        Description (ISAD(G)). Changes were also the result of experimentation
        with the EAD DTD that had occurred since the release of Version 1.0 in
        1998. A few new elements were also added to the EAD DTD. The revision
        of the DTD introduced some structural changes that unbundled certain
        pieces of information in a finding aid, thus facilitating a more logical
        arrangement of information. Restructuring also opened up certain existing
        elements for use inside elements where they had not been allowed before.</P>
      <P>The availability of the 2002 version of the EAD DTD comes at a time
        when more and more users are moving from SGML to XML markup. The entire
        suite of DTD and entity reference files was reengineered to meet the
        needs of XML and related technologies that are currently in use. It is
        hoped that the new 2002 version of the EAD DTD is even more stable and
        useful than the popular 1998 version 1.0. As with related standards,
        the EAD DTD will certain continue to evolve to meet the needs of a growing
        user base.</P>

      <P>This document was revised in December 2002 by Randall K. Barry, U.S.
        Library of Congress, to incorporate information about the EAD 2002 DTD
        development and release. The revised document incorporates text about
        the the August 1996 beta version originally written in 1995 by Sharon
        Gibbs Thibodeau, National Archives and Records Administration, in consultation
        with Daniel V. Pitti, University of California, Berkeley. Sections on
        Version 1.0 (1998) of the EAD DTD were written by Kris Kiesling, Harry
        Ransom Humanities Research Center, and Robert Spindler, Arizona State
        University.</P>
