<h1><a name="skip_menu"></a>Encoded Archival Standards Electronic List</h1>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>The EAD (originally Encoded Archival Description, and now Encoded Archival Standards) Electronic List is an open unmoderated
  electronic mail posting service created to facilitate the exchange of information
  about XML (Extensible Markup Language) DTD (Document Type Definition) and schemas for
  archival finding aids. Please note that the Encoded Archival Standards list retains its former &quot;EAD&quot; name, to keep the list archive and newer postings in one place, and allowing conversations on other encoded archival standards. Developers and implementers of EAD, EAC-CPF and other related standards are welcome
  to join the list and share their ideas and experiences with using XML for finding aids. XML is based on document structure and an encoding
  syntax defined in ISO 8879, the international standard for encoding electronic
  documents. XML was selected as the basis for creating encoded (electronic)
  finding aids since it represents a key component in electronic documentation
  worldwide, particularly via the Internet. As a non-proprietary standard, ISO
  8879 and the EAD implementation of it, should allow different producers of
  archival finding aids to share in electronic form documentation and information
  about the collections they describe.</p>
<p>The EAD list is operated by the U.S. Library of Congress, Network Development
  and MARC Standards Office, which has agreed to serve as the maintenance agency
  for the EAD DTD and schemas. This electronic list makes use of UNIX software available
  24 hours a day at the Library of Congress. This software is used for other
  electronic lists as well including MARC, the general electronic list for the
  MARC Advisory Group. An EAS list message archive is available at: <a href="https://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A0=EAD"> https://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A0=EAD</a></p>

<p>NOTE: Do *not* attempt to unsubscribe by sending a message to the list address "EAD@LOC.GOV".

  you used to subscribe, send a message to the contact person listed below requesting
  that you be unsubscribed. Be sure to give your old address and name in the

<h3>Archive of Posted Messages</h3>
<p>An archive of messages posted to the EAD list is available on a Web server
  maintained by the Library of Congress. The URL for the message archive is:</p>
<p align=center><a href="https://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A0=EAD"> https://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A0=EAD</a></p>
<p>The archive provides sorting of the messages by posting date, author, and
  subject. These sort keys are controled by the date, author, and subject information
  provided by the creator of the message, so this information is not always useful.
  Messages are grouped by the month during which they were posted. Replies to
  specific postings are grouped beneath the entry for the original message when
  the subject lines match.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>EAD is an unmoderated list. All messages sent to the Internet address "EAD@LISTSERV.LOC.GOV" by
  approved subscribers are automatically posted to all other list subscribers.
  EAD is not an open list. Subscriptions are limited to developers and implementers
  and thus pass through an approval process before becoming active. To prevent
  the broadcast of viruses, attachments in emails sent to the list are automatically
  removed.</p>
