<h1><a name="skip_menu"></a>Design Principles</h1>
<h2>For Enhancements to EAD (December
      2002)</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A goal of EAD is to make archival resources from many institutions accessible
    to users. To achieve this goal, EAD must accommodate a wide range of internationally
    divergent descriptive practices. The standard must be responsive to clearly
    articulated needs across the range of institutional or media-specific archival
    contexts.</li>
  <li>EAD element and attribute names must be as universal as possible in both
    language and application to accommodate international interchange. At the
    same time, it is important to provide mechanisms to meet specific language
    or media output needs.</li>
  <li>EAD addresses information about archival resources that is shared publicly.
    It is not a system for collections management activities such as the transfer
    of ownership, conservation, exhibition, use, storage or technical processing
    of materials.</li>
  <li>EAD is a data structure and not a data content standard. It does not prescribe
    how one formulates the data that appears in any given data element - that
    is the role of external national or international data content standards.
    The <em>EAD Tag Library</em> illustrates the type of data that is intended
    to be included in an element to the extent necessary to correlate that element
    to a descriptive area in a particular content standard. At the same time,
    care must be taken to ensure compatibility with such external standards.</li>
  <li>EAD is also a data communication format based on SGML/XML syntax. In some
    environments, archival description will be created and maintained using technologies
    such as relational or object-oriented databases, and EAD will be used principally
    as a transfer mechanism. In other situations, archives will manage descriptive
    data directly in SGML/XML-based systems. EAD must accommodate both environments.</li>
  <li>EAD focuses on the structural content of archival description, not on its
    presentation. However, the standard must provide sufficient mechanisms to
    support output in a variety of formats. These may include traditional forms
    of finding aids such as registers, inventories, and lists of various sorts,
    as well as new output forms for both web display and print.</li>
  <li>The EAD DTD specifies an order and grouping of elements to a limited degree.
    These are the internal structures of the DTD. For most output mechanisms
    using current technology, the order of elements within an EAD instance is
    irrelevant to the output of that data. Changes, as opposed to additions,
    to the structure will not be made simply to facilitate some output sequence
    or product.</li>
  <li>Continuity of structure and content is an important factor in ensuring
    the acceptance and continued application of EAD. While the technological
    environment for EAD is complex and challenging to many institutions, the
    goals of EAD will be best served if technical barriers to its use are minimized.
    Changes to the DTD need to be as technically transparent as possible. In
    general terms this means a preference for adding rather than replacing elements
    and for ensuring that new versions of EAD are backward-compatible.</li>
</ol>
