        <li><strong>Introduction</strong><br />

        <li><strong><a href="pdf/bibframe-update-alaal2018.pdf">Library of Congress BIBFRAME 2.0 Pilot progress report</a></strong> (PDF, 984 KB)<br />

            After almost a year of activity, the LC BIBFARME Pilot 2 has  yielded data and feedback that will inform next steps for LC and BIBRAME. LC has used this information from the Pilot to make decisions and issue a  report assessing the Pilot. The Pilot included catalogers inputting  original cataloging into a BIBFRAME editor that are then added to the Library&rsquo;s BIBFRAME catalog. After a year of changes, data reloads, and  software adjustments, the Library has a working database with four billion  triples converted from 20 million MARC records. Progress and issues  will be discussed along with a description of the merge and match process and  the new input techniques the editor enables, along with its limitations. This presentation will address some of the outcomes and  decisions.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="pdf/share-vde-alaal2018.pdf">From MARC to BIBFRAME in the SHARE-VDE project</a></strong> (PDF, 5 MB)<br />
            <em>Tiziana Possemato, Casalini Libri - @Cult </em><br />
          <a href="http://www.share-vde.org" class="external">SHARE-VDE</a> is a  research and development initiative driven specifically by the library  community to facilitate the implementation of BIBFRAME in libraries. This  presentation describes the project components including: conversion of over 100  million bibliographic and authority records from 12 North American institutions  to BIBFRAME 2.0; reconciliation of entities, creating clusters; enrichment of  these reconciled clusters with URIs from external sources; and the publication,  supply, and management of authority and bibliographical data in RDF. Technical  hurdles will be described, along with the solutions adopted, results, feedback,  and evidence received from the international library community.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="pdf/plainstopeaks-alaal2018.pdf">Using BIBFRAME in multi-institutional projects</a></strong> (PDF, 1.3 MB)<br />
            <em>Jeremy Nelson, Colorado College</em><br />
          The Plains2Peaks service hub project for Colorado and Wyoming  in the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) program uses BIBFRAME linked  data by ingesting metadata from academic and public libraries, consortiums, and  museums into a BIBFRAME RDF knowledge graph from which a Metadata Application  Profile is generated in JSON-LD. The challenge of supporting different  ingestion vocabularies like MODS and Dublin Core and different formats  like JSON, CSV, and XML to BIBFRAME RDF was met through the RDF Mapping  Language (RML) for transforming raw data into BIBFRAME Works, Instances, and  Items. In Colorado Alliance&rsquo;s BIBCAT project, MARCXML from three academic  libraries and one public library is converted to BIBFRAME RDF using the Library  of Congress marc2bibframe software and then mapped via RML from BIBFRAME to <a href="http://Schema.org" class="external">Schema.org</a> for improved web discovery.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="pdf/oclc-converter-alaal2018.pdf">OCLC research with BIBFRAME </a></strong> (PDF, 96 KB)<br />
            <em>Nathan Putnam, OCLC </em><br />
            Since the release of BIBFRAME 2.0 from the Library of  Congress, OCLC Research has experimented with the BIBFRAME 2.0 Converter to  evaluate what type of BIBFRAME data OCLC could produce and what modifications,  if any, were needed to support OCLC use cases. This presentation will discuss  the OCLC Research process in converting approximately 11 million MARC records  to BIBFRAME 2.0, what issues were discovered, and what will continue to be  useful when converting MARC to BIBFRAME.</li>
