<p>The Library of Congress is  pleased to announce that it has   contracted with Zepheira to help accelerate the  launch of the   Bibliographic Framework Initiative.  A major focus of the project is to   translate  the MARC 21 format to a Linked Data (LD) model while   retaining as much as  possible the robust and beneficial aspects of the   historical format.  Zepheira brings to the project extensive  experience   in LD technology for library applications.  </p>
            <p>Eric Miller, who was a leader  in the Semantic Web Initiative in its   early days for the World Wide Web  Consortium (W3C) and who has also   worked in the library and information science  field, leads the Zepheira   team.  The  company, under Mr. Miller’s leadership, has been active in   the development of  Semantic Web and Library standards as well as open   source tools to support LD  technologies and library applications.     These activities represent knowledge and experience that are    instrumental for constructing a core data model and to support prototype    services that will serve as a basis for a new bibliographic framework   and related  services.  </p>
      <p>The Library of Congress has  asked Zepheira to provide a   model (or models) that can serve as a strong  starting point for   discussion, and an analysis of related initiatives underway  that will   be useful to this effort.  LC  expects that the proposed model(s) will   change and be further tuned based on  valuable feedback from the   community and a natural progression of requirements as  they are   addressed. The initial model(s) will serve as a basis for work focused    on a demonstration system/service which will then, in turn, be used to   further refine  the model(s). The expectation is that such iterative   feedback loops will  eventually ensure a flexible bibliographic   framework, a robust reference code, a  supporting infrastructure for   deployment, and an effective migration plan to  support the community in   making a transition from MARC to a new framework.</p>
            <p>The Library of Congress will  now proceed to organize various   scenarios to enable community participation that  will be broad and   include international users and partners, various types of  information   agencies and libraries, and library suppliers.  We will be posting   information as it emerges  from this initial work, especially relating   to projected milestones at the BIBFRAME Web site (<a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibframe/">lcnetdev.github.io/bibframe</a>).          </p>
          <p class="msg-info">The Library intends to offer  its plan of action for   discussion and community input at the American Library  Association   Annual Conference in Anaheim, California. Eric Miller will join the    Library in this update session.  (LC  Bibliographic Framework Transition   Update Forum, Sunday, June 24, 10:30am-12:00  noon, Anaheim Marriott   Grand Salon A-C.)</p>
