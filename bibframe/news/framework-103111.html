<p>The <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/">Working  Group of the Future of Bibliographic Control</a>,   as it examined technology for the  future, wrote that the Library   community’s data carrier, MARC, is “based on  forty-year-old techniques   for data management and is out of step with  programming styles of   today.” <a href="#ftn1" name="ftnref1" title="Note 1" id="ftnref1">[1]</a>    The Working Group called for a format that  will “accommodate and   distinguish expert-, automated-, and self-generated  metadata, including   annotations (reviews, comments) and usage data.” <a href="#ftn2" name="ftnref2" title="Note 2" id="ftnref2">[2]</a>    The Working Group agreed that MARC has served  the library community   well in the pre-Web environment, but something new is now  needed to   implement the recommendations made in the Working Group’s seminal    report. In its recommendations, the Working Group called upon the   Library of  Congress to take action. In recommendation 3.1.1, the   members wrote:</p>
<p>“Recognizing  that Z39.2/MARC are no longer fit   for the purpose, work with the library and  other interested communities   to specify and implement a carrier for  bibliographic information that   is capable of representing the full range of  data of interest to   libraries, and of facilitating the exchange of such data  both within   the library community and with related communities.” <a href="#ftn3" name="ftnref3" title="Note 3" id="ftnref3">[3]</a> </p>
<p>This same theme  emerged from the recent test of the Resource   Description and Access (RDA)  conducted by the National Agricultural   Library, the National Library of  Medicine, and the Library of Congress.   Our 26 test partners also noted that,  were the limitations of the MARC   standard lifted, the full capabilities of RDA  would be more useful to   the library community.  Many of the libraries  taking part in the test   indicated that they had little confidence RDA changes  would yield   significant benefits without a change to the underlying MARC  carrier.    Several of the test  organizations were especially concerned that the   MARC structure would hinder  the separation of elements and ability to   use URLs in a linked data  environment.  </p>
<p>With these  strong statements from two expert groups, the   Library of Congress is committed  to developing, in collaboration with   librarians, standards experts, and  technologists a new bibliographic   framework that will serve the associated  communities well into the   future. Within the Library, staff from the Network  Development and   Standards Office (within the Technology Policy directorate) and  the   Policy and Standards Division (within the Acquisitions and Bibliographic    Access directorate) have been meeting with Beacher Wiggins (Director,   ABA),  Ruth Scovill (Director, Technology Policy), and me to craft a   plan for  proceeding with the development of a bibliographic framework   for the future.</p>
<p>Below this cover  note, you will find our thoughts about the   way ahead. We have identified the  requirements for the new   bibliographic framework, based on the recommendations  made by both the   Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control and the  final   report on the RDA Test.</p>
<p>We at the  Library are committed to finding the necessary   funding for supporting this  initiative, and we expect to work with   diverse and wide-ranging partners in  completing the task. Even at the   earliest stages of the project, we believe two  types of groups are   needed: an advisory committee that will articulate and  frame the   principles and ideals of the bibliographic framework and a technical    committee that has the in-depth knowledge to establish the framework,   itself.</p>
<p>When MARC was  created in the late 1960s, early 1970s, the   Library community, along with  computer scientists, took a bold step   that led to libraries being able to share  bibliographic data. This was   an extraordinary achievement in that individual  libraries became nodes   in a much larger network of library resources. A side  benefit is that   the cost of cataloging was significantly reduced. The new  bibliographic   framework we are aiming for will broaden participation in the  network   of resources, librarians will be able to do a much better job of    linking their patrons to resources of all kinds (from the library and   from many  other sources), and costs can be better contained.</p>
<p>The MARC  standard is responsible for the creation of   millions of bibliographic records  from all parts of the globe. We   recognize the need to continue supporting MARC  during the transition,   and, most likely, for years to come as libraries  determine their   timetable for making a change. The amount of legacy data,  though, does   not deter us from taking responsible actions for the next  generation of   libraries and librarians. The problem has been well defined by  our   partners. We now turn to partners of many types to help us find a   durable  solution.</p>
<p>We are posting this general plan for your comments. Please   let us  know what you think. We are grateful for your interest, and we   appreciate  suggestions for improvement.  We encourage you to post your   thoughts to  the <a href="http://listserv.loc.gov/listarch/bibframe.html">Bibliographic Transition listserv</a>.</p>
<p>Your and others’ comments will be publicly available for all   to  read. It is in this spirit of openness and transparency that we will   proceed  with the development of a bibliographic framework for the 21st   century.</p>
<p>We would also like to solicit your recommendations for   members of  either the advisory or technical committees. However, in the   interest of  privacy, we ask that you submit these (names and contact   details) by email to <a href="mailto:ndmso@loc.gov">ndmso@loc.gov</a>.</p>

<h2>Library of Congress:             Bibliographic Framework Initiative General Plan</h2>
<p>A central activity to the Bibliographic Framework Initiative  is the   development of a new means for capturing and sharing bibliographic    data.  Included in this activity is pursuing a replacement of the MARC    format as the common exchange currency for bibliographic data.  This was   one recommendation of the 2008  report from the Library of Congress'   Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic  Control, <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/news/lcwg-ontherecord-jan08-final.pdf"><em>On  the Record</em></a> [PDF, 103 KB], and has been discussed in the community for a number of    years.  Although the format is deeply  embedded in the infrastructure,   changing technologies and changing resource  description practices   mandate a transition to a more current and forward  looking data   creation and interchange environment.  The semantic web and related   linked data  model hold interesting possibilities for libraries and   cultural heritage  institutions. (Please see the <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/marc/transition/news/framework-103111.html#app">Appendix</a> for a brief history MARC, the issues  arising from its incredible   success, and LC experimentation with alternate  record formats, all of   which inform the following Requirements.) </p>
<h3>Requirements for a  New Bibliographic Framework Environment</h3>
<p>Although the MARC-based infrastructure is extensive, and    MARC has been adapted to changing technologies, a major effort to create   a  comparable exchange vehicle that is grounded in the current and   expected future  shape of data interchange is needed.  To  assure a new   environment will allow reuse of valuable data and remain  supportive of   the current one, in addition to advancing it, the following    requirements provide a basis for this work.   Discussion with colleagues   in the community has informed these  requirements for beginning the   transition to a &quot;new bibliographic  framework&quot;.  Bibliographic framework    is intended to indicate an environment rather than a &quot;format&quot;.</p>
<ul type="disc" class="bullet">
  <li><em>Broad       accommodation of content rules and data models</em>.    The new environment should be agnostic       to cataloging rules, in   recognition that different rules are used by       different   communities, for different aspects of a description, and for         descriptions created in different eras, and that some metadata are not         rule based.  The accommodation of       RDA (Resource Description   and Access) will be a key factor in the       development of elements,   as will other mainstream library, archive, and       cultural community   rules such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd       edition   (AACR2) and its predecessors, as well as DACS (Describing         Archives, a Content Standard), VRA (Visual Resources Association) Core,         CCO (Cataloging Cultural Objects).  </li>
  <li><em>Provision       for types of data that logically accompany or support bibliographic       description</em>,   such as holdings, authority, classification,       preservation,   technical, rights, and archival metadata.  These may be accommodated   through       linking technological components in a modular way,   standard extensions,       and other techniques.</li>
  <li><em>Accommodation       of textual data, linked data with URIs instead of text, and both</em>.    It is recognized that a variety of       environments and systems will   exist with different capabilities for       communicating and receiving   and using textual data and links.</li>
  <li><em>Consideration       of the relationships between and   recommendations for communications format       tagging, record input   conventions, and system storage/manipulation</em>.  While these   environments tend to blur       with today's technology, a future   bibliographic framework is likely to be       seen less by catalogers   than the current MARC format.  Internal storage, displays from         communicated data, and input screens are unlikely to have the close         relationship to a communication format that they have had in the         past.  </li>
  <li><em>Consideration       of the needs of all sizes and types of libraries, from small public to       large research</em>.    The library       community is not homogeneous in the functionality   needed to support its       users in spite of the central role of   bibliographic description of       resources within cultural   institutions.        Although the MARC format became a key factor in the   development of       systems and services, libraries implement services   according to the needs       of their users and their available   resources.  The new bibliographic framework will       continue to   support simpler needs in addition to those of large research         libraries.</li>
  <li><em>Continuation       of maintenance of MARC until no longer necessary</em>.    It is recognized that systems and       services based on the MARC 21   communications record will be an important       part of the   infrastructure for many years.        With library budgets already   stretched to cover resource purchases,       large system changes are   difficult to implement because of the associated       costs. With the   migration in the near term of a large segment of the       library   community from AACR to RDA, we will need to have RDA-adapted MARC         available.  While that need is       already being addressed, it is   recognized that RDA is still evolving and       additional changes may   be required.        Changes to MARC not associated with RDA should be   minimal as the       energy of the community focuses on the   implementation of RDA and on this       initiative.  </li>
  <li><em>Compatibility       with MARC-based records</em>.     While       a new schema for communications could be radically   different, it will need       to enable use of data currently found in   MARC, since redescribing       resources will not be feasible.          Ideally there would be an option to preserve all data from a MARC         record.  </li>
  <li><em>Provision       of transformation from MARC 21 to a new bibliographic environment</em>.    A key requirement will be software that       converts data to be moved   from MARC to the new bibliographic framework and       back, if   possible, in order to enable experimentation, testing, and other         activities related to evolution of the environment. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Library of Congress (LC) and its MARC partners are    interested in a deliberate change that allows the community to move into   the  future with a more robust, open, and extensible carrier for our   rich  bibliographic data, and one that better accommodates the library   community's  new cataloging rules, RDA.  The effort  will take place in   parallel with the maintenance of MARC 21 as new models are  tested.  It   is expected that new systems  and services will be developed to help   libraries and provide the same cost  savings they do today.     Sensitivity to  the effect of rapid change enables gradual   implementation by systems and  infrastructures, and preserves   compatibility with existing data.  </p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The new  bibliographic framework project will be focused on   the Web environment, Linked  Data principles and mechanisms, and the   Resource Description Framework (RDF) as  a basic data model.  The   protocols and  ideas behind Linked Data are natural exchange mechanisms   for the Web that have  found substantial resonance even beyond the   cultural heritage sector.  Likewise, it is expected that the use of RDF    and other W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) developments will enable the   integration of library data and other  cultural heritage data on the Web   for more expansive user access to  information.  </p>
<p>Regarding a general  data model, developments in web modeling   are currently centered on RDF, which  is a W3C recommended method for   conceptual description or modeling of  information.  RDF data can be    &quot;serialized&quot; or &quot;written out&quot; in several different syntax  formats, one   of which is XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  RDF  data may be used in   relational databases, which underlie most library catalogs  today, just   as MARC 21 records are used in most library catalogs.  Triplestores,   which are databases designed  specifically for storing and querying RDF   data, are widely and readily  available, and promise to provide the   library community with more options about  how to store and retrieve its   data in the future.  </p>
<p>Embracing common  exchange techniques (the Web and Linked   Data) and broadly adopted data models  (RDF) will move the current   library-technological environment away from being a  niche market unto   itself to one more readily understandable by present and  future data   creators, data modelers, and software developers.  It is anticipated   that all of these  considerations, taken together, will result in   greater cost savings for  libraries.  For example, libraries will  be   able to take advantage of a broader selection of technological solutions   and  leverage the knowledge and skills of current and future   professionals.  Those professionals are, or will be, deeply  conversant   with more contemporary data creation, data modeling, and software    development practices. </p>
<p>The following  investigations are projected but do not   preclude others that are identified in  the exploration of this   initiative.</p>
<p><em>Developing  possible interaction scenarios within the information community</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Some modeling of  interaction of information community   entities and services is needed to help  guide the initial development   of the types of services and types of requisite  metadata models for the   community.   Development of use cases will help to scope the boundaries   of the new  bibliographic framework initiative development and its   interdependence with  other data initiatives, for example PREMIS   (Preservation Metadata  Implementation Strategies) or METS (Metadata   Encoding and Transfer  Standard).  This will focus, in particular, on   scenarios  in which RDF and linked data play a central role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Developing domain  ontologies for the description of resources and related data in scope.</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An RDF data model  addresses a particular domain, such as   description metadata used by the  cultural heritage institutions,   through development of domain ontologies  (roughly comparable to the   tagging of MARC plus the interrelationship of tagged  elements, such as   which elements can occur together and how many times).  The community   has created and experimented  with ontologies in several cultural   heritage areas and they will be considered  in this activity.  For   example, the  Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) abstract model is   an example of a  foundation, upper level model that would be important   to review.  Other ontologies are being used or developed  by the Library   of Congress, International Federation of Library Associations  and   Institutions (IFLA) groups, and experimenters in the bibliographic    community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Organizing  prototyping and reference implementations</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This work is already  underway in projects by the Library of   Congress, OCLC (Online Computer   Library Center), British Library (BL),   and Deutsche Nationalbibliothek  (DNB), among others.  Experimentation    with new models that are supportive of an RDF data exchange environment   is  needed.  This activity will be informed  by use case requirements   and other studies noted above. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key component of  this work will be collaboration.  Close    collaboration with the principal MARC partner institutions -- Libraries   and  Archive Canada (LAC), BL, and DNB -- will be instrumental.  Forums   such as the MARC advisory bodies  (e.g., American Library Association's   Machine-Readable Bibliographic  Information Committee (MARBI), Canadian   Committee on MARC (CCM)) will be called  upon for review and asked for   input.   Networks like OCLC and the vendor community whose valuable and   valued  services are built around MARC are needed for advice,   prototyping, and  development of reference implementations, which will   not only help determine  the practicality of specific solutions and   assumed specifications but also  provide sample implementations for the   community.  Institutions currently pioneering RDF  services with library   data and others will be involved and will provide  valuable   experience.  Input from the  resource description community that is   involved in modeling and in development  and refinement of RDA will also   be important.   Mechanisms will be developed to identify other active   participation and  prototyping as this initiative progresses. </p>
<h3>Project timetable  (preliminary) </h3>
<p> The Library of  Congress will be developing a grant   application over the next few months to  support this initiative.  The   two-year  grant will provide funding for the Library of Congress to   organize consultative  groups (national and international) and to   support development and prototyping  activities.  Some of the supported    activities will be those described above:   developing models and   scenarios for interaction within the information  community, assembling   and reviewing ontologies currently used or under  development,   developing domain ontologies for the description of resources and    related data in scope, organizing prototypes and reference   implementations. <strong><br clear="all" />

<h2 id="app">Appendix:  A Brief  History of MARC 21 </h2>
<p>The MARC 21 format was developed in the late 1960s to encode    the data recorded on catalog cards into machine-readable form and thus   enable  the Library of Congress to communicate its cataloging data   electronically to  other institutions.  Initially it was  viewed as a   carrier for cataloging data that was specified by the  Anglo-American   Cataloguing Rules (AACR) and earlier library rule sets.  </p>
<p>A MARC 21 record has three basic components: the <em>communication  format structure</em>, the <em>data element set</em>, and the <em>data</em>,  structured according to content standards. The <em>communication format structure</em> was designed to carry data for the  exchange of information between   systems; data that could be used in a variety  of processing   environments. The communications  format structurewas  approved as a   National Information Standards Organization (NISO) (Z39.2) and  then   International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (2709) standard,    promoting its widespread adoption and use by libraries.</p>
<p>The <em>data element set</em> (MARC fields and tags)    identifies and characterizes the specific pieces of data within a record   to  support its use and manipulation.  The  data element set that   became MARC 21, used the ISO 2709 format structure for its  carrier. </p>
<p>The <em>data</em> is primarily defined outside of the format,    both through content standards or general rule sets (e.g., AACR2, RDA,   and others) and as the content  of specific data elements (e.g., terms   from a thesaurus of subjects).  The MARC format documentation has   provided  usage guidelines that reflect the International Standard   Bibliographic  Description (ISBD), aspects of the AACR rules, and   Library of Congress (LC)  practices.  In a few cases the MARC 21   documentation  stipulates the structure of data to better support   machine processing. </p>
<p>While the initial focus of MARC was bibliographic data for <u>books</u>,    over the following 20 years the original format developed into a   family of  formats and added functionality in response to the library   community to enable  broader applications.  These include:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>The       ability to describe other forms of material,   incorporating serials, sound       recordings, still and moving images,   maps, archival material, computer       software, etc.</li>
  <li>Accommodation       of bibliographic content rules other   than AACR (and its predecessors), as       well as DACS (Describing   Archives, a Content Standard) for archival       descriptions and CCO   (Cataloging Cultural Objects) for cultural       objects.  There are   currently 39       sets of content rules that have been registered in   the MARC source code       list to specify a rule set used for the   content of a MARC record, and       others are used without   registration.        While some of these may be obsolete in the future   and not all of       these will require support, the number of   registered content rules       underscores the importance, adoption, and   versatility of the MARC 21       format.</li>
  <li>Metadata       beyond descriptive data that allowed   institutions to support a larger       range of its activities,   including the Authority format, Holdings format,       Classification   format, and Community Information format. This development       allowed   MARC 21 to communicate data that supported many functions in a         library or other cultural heritage institution: search and discovery,         acquisitions (including automated check-in), inventory, and   circulation,       and it enabled the communication of important support   data such as name       and subject thesauri and classification   schemes.  The content rules for such data vary       greatly, from the   NISO standard for holdings data to detailed rules that support       the   Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) to local conventions.   </li>
  <li>Coordination       of data elements across functions to   enable the development of integrated       library systems where   bibliographic, authority, and holdings data are       highly   interrelated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the last 20 years there were several developments that  made MARC 21 what it is today:</p>
<ul type="disc" class="bullet">
  <li><em>Format       integration and simplification.  </em>This         brought the data elements for different forms of material   together,       eliminating special fields defined only for a particular   form of material.</li>
  <li><em>Expansions       for digital resources</em>. Changes   were made to better describe digital       resources and to allow for   linking of records to other resources on the       Internet. </li>
  <li><em>Integration       with other national formats</em>.The   MARC 21 formats were adjusted       to enable countries with national   formats to move to MARC 21 in order to       take advantage of the   active MARC 21 record sharing environment and the       development of   highly standardized integrated library systems and       bibliographic   networks. </li>
  <li><em>Accommodating       RDA</em>.  Over the last few years         proposals and discussion papers were prepared and changes adopted   so that       the MARC 21 formats could better carry data cataloged   using the new RDA       content rules. This work is ongoing.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Current Environment</strong></h3>
<p>There is widespread and worldwide adoption of MARC 21,  resulting in   thousands of highly developed systems that work with and/or expect    MARC, including integrated library systems, networks, auxiliary services   (e.g.,  distributors sending MARC records with books and services that   massage or  reformat data content to make it more consistent), etc.    Extensive open source tools and systems have  been built around MARC 21   to enable enhanced search, discovery, and display of  MARC records.    Many countries have  retooled to move to MARC 21 in the recent past so   they could take advantage of  the record sharing in the MARC 21   environment.   As a result there are over a billion MARC 21 compatible   records in large  and small network and local systems.  The  MARC tools   and systems support are highly evolved and heavily used to reduce    costs. In addition, users of non-AACR/RDA cataloging rules (e.g., DACS   and CCO)  use MARC to enable integration of their data with library   data. Coordinated  MARC formats such as authorities, holdings, and   classification are being used  for communication of specialized data.</p>
<p>In short, the MARC format was the most important piece of    the infrastructure that developed between the 1970s and the present as   it  enabled development of a highly successful record sharing   environment that resulted  in large cost savings for libraries.   Initially the environment focused around  LC providing its catalog   records as a service to other libraries and later  included wide sharing   across institutions, with networks like OCLC (Online Computer   Library   Center)  playing a key role. </p>
<h3>Issues Today</h3>
<p>The MARC format has been in use for over 40 years and, while    that longevity has enabled development of a very rich environment that   depends  on the format for data exchange, it has also created issues   that make change  difficult.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="ltr">A widely used format with open    maintenance procedures like MARC builds up redundancies over time as   cataloging  rules and conventions change, and types of data are   accommodated, such as  transcribed data, cataloger-supplied elements,   authorized forms, coded data,  and textual data.  Because MARC has    always been maintained with sensitivity to the fact that most systems   will have  older records containing currently obsolete data, the   longevity of the format  complicates simplification efforts and reuse of   data tags. </span></li>
  <li><span dir="ltr">While the format was seldom used  by   systems as an internal format, over time it influenced the format for   record  creation activities, causing thousands of catalogers to learn   the format tags  and subfields names.  </span></li>
  <li><span dir="ltr">New ideas for the organization of  data   are difficult to accommodate in the format in a desirable manner because    they would make data incompatible with earlier data.</span></li>
  <li><span dir="ltr">Other limitations for the format  are a result of choices made in the initial development of the format.     </span></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the format is “tuned” to the data specificity    of library cataloging traditions that are evolving toward newer models.    These include simpler models such as Dublin  Core with the expectation   that less specific, textual data can be understood  and used by   computers, obviating the need for the detailed data identification  and   coded data found in MARC 21.   On the  other hand, there is a call for   more data identification specificity in newer  content rules such as RDA   in order to support rich linking of data.  Both point to different   requirements for data  exchange format standards. </p>
<h3>Recent Initiatives</h3>
<p><em>Developing XML formats for bibliographic and related  data.  </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Newer structures such as the widely implemented XML    (eXtensible Markup Language) have flexibility, almost unlimited tagging    ability, and can provide user-friendly tags. In addition, XML tools are   not  only very mature but also continue to be developed at a rapid   rate, as are  auxiliary XML standards that support the XML environment   such as eXtensible Stylesheet  Language Transformations (XSLT) (which   facilitate conversion between different  XML data schemas) and XML Query   (XQuery) (which provides an efficient method  for finding information   in XML data).   Thus an alternative format structure for MARC 21 was   established in  recent years: MARCXML, which is simply a transformation   of the ISO 2709  structure of MARC 21 to an XML structure leaving the   MARC 21 tagging and coding  of data intact.</p>
  <p>Another initiative has been the development of MODS    (Metadata Object Description Schema) and MADS (Metadata Authority   Description  Schema), which are XML schema that are highly compatible   with MARC  bibliographic and authority data but have somewhat simpler   word-based  tagging.  They also address some of the  organizational,   extensibility, and linking needs of bibliographic data  today.  This   effort has dealt with the  limitations of MARC tagging and organization   of data, while retaining much of  its ability to carry rich   bibliographic data that is used in our current  technical environment.   Partially in response to library administrator pressure  for decades,   MODS intentionally avoids the detailed tagging and redundancies  found   in MARC. </p>
  <p>Both MARCXML and MODS were developed partly to enable    MARC-related bibliographic data to be in synch with communication   protocols  such as SRU (Search and Retrieve via URL) and OAI (Open   Archive Initiative) and  formats like METS (Metadata Encoding and   Transfer Standard) that prefer or  require XML data records.  These have    given the community experience with using a different structure.  MADS   in RDF (Resource Description Framework)  is another area where   development is enabling experimentation with a different  structure.</p>
  <p>LC has also maintained transformations for the MARCXML,    MODS, MADS, and Dublin Core data formats and shared them with the   community,  yielding valuable experience in the ease and difficulty of   transformation of  data between formats that may have different   granularity in tagging. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Accommodating RDA. </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Network Development and MARC    Standards Office (NDMSO) at LC has worked with the community to   integrate RDA  data in the MARC 21 format. This still ongoing effort has   enabled the MARC  format to better accommodate data formulated   according to RDA instructions.  Mappings between RDA and MARC and RDA   and MODS are published in the RDA  Toolkit.  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>Making LC vocabularies available as Linked Data. </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>LC  has   developed and implemented a web service for stable and trusted   vocabularies  which has contributed to experimentation with linked data   in the community  (id.loc.gov).  As part of this  initiative, a data   model for MADS as RDF was developed that enables this linked  data   service to expose the rich MARC data in an RDF form.  RDF is currently   the preferred linked data  publishing model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Increased interest in and  experimentation with RDF-based models</em>.   </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While still in a developmental and  experimental stage, the theories   and technologies of the Linked Data initiative  being explored by the   W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) may provide the potential  to widely   share our rich bibliographic and related data with communities both    within and outside of the library environment.   Over the last year an   international group sponsored by the W3C studied  the potential for   library data in the Linked Data space.  The conclusion was positive, and   a great deal  of thought went in to identifying possible use cases and   recommendations.</p>
