      <h2><span class="dot-top">Bibliographic  Framework as a Web of Data: Linked Data Model and Supporting Services</span></h2>
<p>The Library of Congress is pleased to   report that we have  reached two important milestones with respect to   our Bibliographic Framework  Initiative: the introduction of a draft    data model for web-based bibliographic description and a first meeting   of a  small group of early experimenters currently exploring the   feasibility of the  proposed model.  The new model is simply called    BIBFRAME, short for Bibliographic Framework.</p>
            <p>The model document is a high-level view of the BIBFRAME model  - a   primer.  Although the model is a  draft and expected to change, we want   to share it now with the community not  only so that you are informed of   progress being made but also to engender  conversation and constructive   feedback.   The URL for the document <em>Bibliographic  Framework as a Web of Data: Linked Data Model and Supporting Service</em>s is:  <a href="../pdf/marcld-report-11-21-2012.pdf">http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibframe/pdf/marcld-report-11-21-2012.pdf</a> [PDF]</p>
      <p>As the document states in its introduction, much remains to  be done,   but it is important to remember that this model, like MARC, must be    able to accommodate any number of content models and specific   implementations  of the broader information community, but still enable   data exchange between  libraries.</p>
            <p>Our second milestone was partnering with six organizations to  join   us in testing and experimenting with this new model.  We call these   organizations the Early  Experimenters and they are:  British  Library,   Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, George  Washington University,  National   Library of Medicine, OCLC, and Princeton University  -- and of course   LC.   We met in  Washington, DC for two days in October and since then   we have all be  investigating how past and future data might fit into   the model.  After a follow-up meeting in December, they  have agreed to   share the experience and results with the wider community with  the   expectation it will stimulate broader explorations.  The Library of   Congress will be doing the  same, on both counts.          </p>
          <p class="msg-info">To that end we are again planning an update session at ALA in Seattle.  It will be on <strong>Sunday, January 27, 2013 (10:30-12:00,  in the Conference Center of the Washington Convention    Center, Room 304)</strong>.  </p>
