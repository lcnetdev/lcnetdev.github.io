      <h3>Meeting Summary (Dallas, Texas, January 22, 2012)</h3>
<p><strong>1. Greeting and Introductions (Beacher Wiggins, Deanna  Marcum, others)</strong><br />
  Beacher  Wiggins, director for acquisitions and bibliographic   access, Library of  Congress, welcomed the audience of about 110 people,   including representatives  of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek,   Biblioteca Nacional de España, and Library  and Archives Canada, to the   first Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework  Transition Initiative   Update Forum.  He  explained that the Library of Congress, the   institution that led the  development of the MARC formats in the late   1960s, intended to maintain MARC as  long as necessary but at the same   time had begun to seek a better framework for  the encoding and   distribution of bibliographic data in the broadest sense,  including   authority data.  He said that  LC had convened this Forum, the first in a   series, to learn how the Library of  Congress could engage the   community in the Bibliographic Framework Transition  project and to   foster dialogue about community concerns.  Wiggins mentioned the other   Library of  Congress staff who were currently working on the project:   Ann Della Porta,  Chief, Integrated Library System Program Office; Kevin   Ford, Digital Project  Coordinator, Network Development and MARC   Standards Office (NDMSO); Sally  McCallum, Chief, NDMSO; Susan Morris,   Special Assistant to the Director for  Acquisitions and Bibliographic   Access;   Dave Reser, Senior Cataloging Policy Specialist, Policy &amp;   Standards  Division (PSD); Ruth Scovill, Director for Technology Policy;   and Barbara  Tillett, Chief, PSD.</p>
<p><strong>2. Opening statements</strong><br />
  <strong>a.  Need for a new bibliographic framework (Deanna Marcum)</strong><br />
  The first speaker was Dr. Deanna  Marcum, who recently retired   as associate librarian of Congress for Library Services  and is now   managing director of the not-for-profit strategic consulting service    Ithaka S+R.  Marcum explained that she  had grappled for years with the   question of how to evolve from the MARC format  that has been the   principal bibliographic data carrier since the late 1960s to  a flexible   framework suited to the World Wide Web.  At the 2005 ALA Midwinter   Meeting in Boston,  Mass., she spoke to the EBSCO Leadership Seminar on   “The Future of  Cataloging.”  That speech caused her to  think in   earnest about what we as a community need to do to produce relevant    bibliographic control for the digital age.   The vast quantity of legacy   data expressed only in MARC made it  difficult to contemplate such a   shift, but two events showed that the time for  a new framework had   come.</p>
<p> First, in January 2008, the  Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control (&lt;<a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/">http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/</a>&gt;)   made  108 recommendations to LC and the community.   Among these, the   Working Group recommended suspension of work on the new  cataloging   instructions <em>RDA: Resource Description and Access</em> and    development of a more flexible, extensible metadata carrier that would   promote  easier interchange of metadata among libraries and other parts   of the  information community.  At Marcum’s  suggestion, the Library of   Congress, National Agricultural Library, and  National Library of   Medicine conducted a large-scale national test of RDA and  issued a   joint decision in June 2011 on how they would implement it.</p>
<p> Second, in its resulting report  &lt;<a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/rda/source/rdatesting-finalreport-20june2011.pdf">http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibliographic-future/rda/source/rdatesting-finalreport-20june2011.pdf</a>&gt;,    the US RDA Test Coordinating Committee of LC, NAL, and NLM specified    &quot;credible progress toward a replacement for MARC&quot; as one of the    necessary conditions for implementing RDA.</p>
<p> In May 2011 Marcum therefore assigned Wiggins,   McCallum, and several other LC managers to begin the   transition to a   new bibliographic framework. Mindful of the  Library’s huge investment   in MARC, she asked the LC team what MARC’s primary  inventor, Henriette   D. Avram, would have done in the age of Google.  All agreed that Avram   would not have viewed  MARC as the final answer, but would have overseen   an evolution of MARC to meet  contemporary needs.  The LC team drafted a    high-level plan for the transition and posted it to the Library's new    Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative Website (<a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibframe/">http://lcnetdev.github.io/bibframe/</a>)    on October 31, 2011.  The plan calls for  formation of two groups, an   advisory group to establish overall principles and  a technical   development group.   Marcum,  noting that all parts of the library   community are struggling with the same  question—how to do the best job   we can for future generations—said she had  agreed to serve, on a   volunteer basis, as the chair of the advisory group.</p>
<p><strong>b.  Overview of initial plan for Bibliographic Framework Transition, issued October  31, 2011 (Sally McCallum)</strong><br />
  McCallum gave a brief overview of  the October 31 plan.  She   stressed that  the plan is very high-level at this time; its purpose was   to set forth future  requirements, propose ways to investigate next   steps, and suggest how the  Library of Congress and the community can   handle their legacy data and systems.    The  plan envisions a new   framework that features:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Broad accommodation  of content rules and data   models--The new framework must be agnostic to  cataloging rules, because   in addition to RDA, it must accommodate descriptions  in <em>Describing Archives: A Content Standard </em>(DACS), <em>Cataloging  Cultural Objects</em> (CCO), and specialized rule sets such as those used in the  sciences;</li>
  <li> Provision for  types of data that logically accompany or support bibliographic description;</li>
  <li> Accommodation of  textual data, linked data with   URIs instead of text, and both—a requirement  since libraries are not   all alike now, and never will be all alike;</li>
  <li> Consideration of  the relationships between   and recommendations for communications format  tagging, record input   conventions, and system storage/manipulation—cataloging  interfaces have   been very MARC-like, but end-user interfaces have become much  more   varied, and McCallum predicted that there would be increasingly diverse    interfaces for both;</li>
  <li> Consideration of  the needs of all sizes and types of libraries, from small public to large  research;</li>
  <li> Continuation of  maintenance of MARC until no longer necessary;</li>
  <li> Compatibility with  MARC-based records;</li>
  <li> Provision of  transformation from MARC21 to a new bibliographic environment;</li>
  <li>The plan commits the Library to maintaining MARC for as    long as necessary and to providing automated tools for transforming data   from  MARC to the new framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter  will most likely be based on Linked Data   principles and use the Resource  Description Framework (RDF), a World   Wide Web Consortium specification, as its  basic data model.  The new   framework will  support many more options for data storage and retrieval   than is the case  now.  McCallum envisioned development of  RDF   ontologies for the new bibliographic framework.  Above all, she stressed   the need for  community collaboration.  She recalled  that Avram,   leading the development of MARC more than forty years ago, made it  a   practice to develop a small piece of the format, have it reviewed and   adjust  it accordingly, then issue another small piece, in an iterative   process that  resulted in a very robust and widely accepted format.</p>
<p><strong>3. Updates</strong><br />
  <strong>a.  Synopsis of responses to initial Transition plan (Sally McCallum)</strong><br />
  McCallum  encouraged all Forum attendees to subscribe to the BIBFRAME listserv (&lt;<a href="http://listserv.loc.gov/listarch/bibframe.html">http://listserv.loc.gov/listarch/bibframe.html</a>&gt;)  and make and follow comments there.   Comments to date have highlighted several themes: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Core  data: how will the developers determine   what elements are core, in a world in  which every data element is core   to someone?</li>
  <li> Goals  of the Bibliographic Framework Transition   with respect to end users: how will  it enable libraries to deliver   more value to patrons?</li>
  <li> Goals  with respect to catalogers: the new framework is not likely to prescribe an  interface. </li>
</ul>
<p> McCallum  added that several national libraries   abroad had submitted statements of  support for the Transition   Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>b.  Funding for the Transition Initiative (Deanna Marcum)</strong><br />
  Marcum  said she had promised to pursue funding for the   Transition Initiative and hoped  to have some funding commitments this   winter.   The community conversation on the new bibliographic framework   had to  include voices from other countries and from around the U.S., a   factor that  would make the project expensive.   [Wiggins mentioned   after the Forum that the LC group hoped to host a  series of   invitational meetings in different regions, as the Working Group on  the   Future of Bibliographic Control had done in 2007.]  Marcum would chair   the Transition Initiative  Advisory Group that would provide long-term   guidance, monitor costs, and ensure  that libraries’ managers were   informed about the Initiative as it progressed.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>c.  Advisory and Technical Groups (Beacher Wiggins, Deanna Marcum)</strong><br />
  Wiggins said that the technical  group would develop the new   framework in modules.  He said that LC didn’t plan to announce the   members  of either group until both were fully populated.  He said that   LC also envisioned the formation  of several technical subgroups to work   on various aspects of the  framework.  He encouraged those  interested   in serving on a group or subgroup to email <a href="mailto:ndmso@loc.gov">ndmso@loc.gov</a></p>
<p><strong>4. Expectations for and from the community</strong><br />
  This  topic was folded into previous agenda items.</p>
<p><strong>5. Questions and answers/Open discussion (All)</strong><br />
  <em>Elizabeth O’Keefe: </em>What is the nature of the commitments  of time and resources that will be expected of advisory and technical group  members?<br />
  <em>Wiggins  replied:</em> The Library of Congress and Marcum   are seeking funding to host at  least one face-to-face meeting for each   group in 2012.  No one in either group would be expected to  make it a   full-time job.</p>
<p><em>Paul J. Weiss:</em> What role do you see for other countries’  MARC maintenance agencies?<br />
  <em>McCallum  replied:</em> They’ll be eagerly invited to participate; several national ibraries  have sent messages of support for the initiative.</p>
<p><em>Louise Ratliff:</em> Please post some “recommended reading” on  the Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative Website.<br />
  <em>Wiggins  replied: </em>An excellent suggestion.  LC  will   undertake to post a bibliography of readings.  Recommended readings will   touch on the Resource  Description Framework, Linked Systems, and other   relevant topics.</p>
<p><em>John Espley: </em>Is there a way to make the BIBFRAME listserv  comments more to the point?  The tone is  sometimes negative.<br />
  <em>McCallum  replied:</em> We feel that people need to have a voice and should be able to feel  that their input is considered.</p>
<p><em>John Attig:</em> BIBFRAME readers and the Forum audience   would  welcome a direct conversation with the decision-makers for the   Transition  Initiative.  They want LC people to  express individual   viewpoints on the listserv.</p>
<p><em>Robert Ellett: </em>The ALCTS Webinar on RDA by Marcum and  Wiggins in August 2011 was excellent; will there be more such opportunities?<br />
  <em>Wiggins  replied</em> that additional Webinars, by LC, ALCTS, or other entities, were under  consideration.</p>
<p><em>Janet Ahrberg:</em> Are you involving vendors in the Transition  Initiative?<br />
  <em>Wiggins  replied</em> that this was already underway.</p>
<p><em>John F. Myers:</em> When you’re used to a certain   framework of  perception, it’s hard to recognize the next dimension as   it unfolds.  Those working on the Transition Initiative  shouldn’t let   negative remarks discourage them.   It is important to provide for   transformations from MARC to the new  framework, but it makes sense to   develop the new framework first and then build  bridges back to MARC.</p>
<p><em>Diane Hillmann: </em>Wishes LC members would respond to    comments on BIBFRAME with their personal opinions.  The suggestion that   LC is developing the Next  Big Thing calls for reassurance that the   community will be full participants so  that siloing can be avoided.    There is  concern in the community about all having a voice in the   discussion.</p>
<p><em>Paul J. Weiss: </em>It’s understandable that vendors and    national libraries must have unified voices, but nowadays the community    considers the Library of Congress a partner, not a parent.  Framework   developers should not worry about  having disagreements in public view   of the community.</p>
<p><em>John Attig:</em>  “Made  at LC,” or even “Made in libraries,” would not be desirable.</p>
<p><em>Cheryl Cook:</em> Framework groups should look at Kuali   OLE, a  community-wide research library management system using   open-source software,  because it links financial and bibliographic   data.<br />
  <em>Wiggins  replied</em> that the Framework would indeed consider this kind of linking.</p>
<p>The Forum closed with a comment that the library community  needs a Mark Zuckerberg (chief executive of Facebook).</p>
