<p class="msg-info">The Library of Congress is sharing this   statement, by Deanna B. Marcum, LC’s Associate Librarian for Library   Services for the benefit of its external constituents.  Dr. Marcum will   be leading the initiative that will drive this transformation process.    The Library is mounting the statement now for early review.  Following   the June 2011 Annual Conference of the American Library Association,   where discussions about the statement will occur, the Library will make   further announcements.</p>
        <p>The recent publication of <em>Resource  Description &amp; Access</em> (RDA), and the US National Test of RDA that is now  being analyzed,   have come at a time when technological and environmental  changes are   once again causing the library community to rethink the future of    bibliographic control, including the MARC 21 communication formats.  The   content and packaging of RDA itself  attempt to address this question   and in so doing have raised further  issues.  Quite apart from a   decision  about implementing RDA, we must evaluate the wider   bibliographic framework.</p>
<p>Adding to the uncertainties that accompany change, libraries   and other  cultural heritage institutions and information centers around   the world are  facing serious budgetary constraints.   Cultural   heritage institutions see their resources dwindling at the same  time   that they need to invest in dramatic new uses of bibliographic data.  In   this environment, many institutions have  been forced to relax   standards of quality in bibliographic records while still  being asked   to broaden their services, especially in terms of the availability  of   digital data.  Efficiencies in the  creation and sharing of cataloging   metadata are therefore imperative:  information providers and cultural   heritage institutions must reevaluate their  use of scarce resources,   both as individual organizations and as a community.</p>
        <p>The Associate Librarian of Congress for Library Services,   Deanna Marcum,  is leading an initiative at the Library to analyze the   present and future  environment, identify the components of the   framework to support our users, and  plan for the evolution from our   present framework to the future—not just for  the Library of Congress,   but for all institutions that depend on bibliographic  data shared by   the Library and its partners.   The Library of Congress has invested   considerable resources in the  development of broadly implemented   encoding standards such as MARC 21, as well  as cataloging standards and   vocabularies such as the <em>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd Edition</em> (AACR2),  RDA, and the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).    Spontaneous comments from participants in the  US RDA Test show that a   broad cross-section of the community feels budgetary  pressures but   nevertheless considers it necessary to replace MARC 21 in order  to reap   the full benefit of new and emerging content standards.  The Library   now seeks to evaluate how its  resources for the creation and exchange   of metadata are currently being used  and how they should be directed in   an era of diminishing budgets and heightened  expectations in the   broader library community.</p>
        <p>The  Library of Congress will address these issues:</p>
        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Determine which aspects of current  metadata encoding   standards should be retained and evolved into a format for  the future.    We will consider MARC 21, in  which billions of records are presently   encoded, as well as other initiatives.</li>
          <li>Experiment with Semantic Web and  linked data technologies   to see what benefits to the bibliographic framework  they offer our   community and how our current models need to be adjusted to take  fuller   advantage of these benefits.</li>
          <li>Foster maximum re-use of library  metadata in the broader   Web search environment, so that end users may be  exposed to more   quality metadata and/or use it in innovative ways.</li>
          <li>Enable users to navigate  relationships among   entities—such as persons, places, organizations, and  concepts—to search   more precisely in library catalogs and in the broader  Internet.  We   will explore the use of  promising data models such as <em>Functional  Requirements for Bibliographic Records </em>(FRBR) in navigating relationships,  whether those are actively encoded by librarians or made discernible by the  Semantic Web.</li>
          <li>Explore approaches to displaying  metadata beyond current MARC-based systems.</li>
          <li>Identify the risks of action and  inaction, including an   assessment of the pace of change acceptable to the  broader community:   will we take incremental steps or take bolder, faster  action?</li>
          <li>Plan for bringing existing  metadata into new   bibliographic systems within the broader Library of Congress  technical   infrastructure—a critical consideration given the size and value of  our   legacy databases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Library of Congress’s process will be fully   collaborative.  We will consult our partners and customers in  the   metadata community, standards experts in and out of libraries, and    designers and builders of systems that make use of library metadata.  We   intend to host meetings during conferences  of the American Library   Association, specialized library associations, and  international   organizations, as well as special “town hall” meetings open to  the   metadata community, to gather input from all interested parties.  We   plan to establish an electronic discussion  group for constant   communication during the effort of reshaping our  bibliographic   framework, and we expect to host a series of invitational  meetings of   experts and stakeholders in 2012 and 2013.</p>
