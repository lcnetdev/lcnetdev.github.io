              <p> He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and  waging War against us.</p>
              <p>                He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed  the lives of our people. </p>
              <p>                He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to   compleat  the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with   circumstances of  Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most   barbarous ages, and  totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br />
                He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to   bear  Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their   friends and  Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. </p>
              <p>                He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to   bring  on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian   Savages, whose known  rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction   of all ages, sexes and  conditions.</p>
              <p>                In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for  Redress in   the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered  only   by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act    which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. </p>
