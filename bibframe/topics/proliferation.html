      <p>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish  brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their  legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded  them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have  appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by  the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would  inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been  deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore,  acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as  we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</p>
              <p>                We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of  America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the  world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of  the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these  United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that  they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all  political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought  to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have  full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce,  and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection  of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes  and our sacred Honor.</p>
