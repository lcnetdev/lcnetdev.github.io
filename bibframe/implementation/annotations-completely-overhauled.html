Thus each cataloging resource must have a work description, and, if the cataloging resource exists physically or electronically, one or more instance descriptions." />

          <h2>Introduction </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
          <div class="section">
            <p> An annotation asserts information about a resource. Comments on the web about photos,  videos, and articles; reviews of restaurants and books -- these are considered to be annotations. When an annotation asserts information about a BIBFRAME resource, we refer to it as a BIBFRAME annotation. </p>
            <p>An annotation involves three resources: (1) the annotation itself, (2) the annotation target, (3) the annotation body. The annotation points to both the target and the body, and conveys that the body is somehow &quot;about&quot; or &quot;related to&quot; the target. This is illustrated in the following diagram.</p>
            <p><img src="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/images/intro_model.png" alt="Basic Annotation Model" width="400" /></p>
            <p>A book, for example, might be described by a BIBFRAME Work.&nbsp;&nbsp; There may be a  review of that book.  An annotation might be created to say that  
              this resource -the review, is about that resource -the book.  The Work is the target of the annotation; the review is the body. </p>
            <p>.For a BIBFRAME annotation, the  target is a BIBFRAME resource: Work,  Instance, Authority, or Annotation.</p>
            <h3>Relationship to W3C Work on Web Annotations</h3>
            <p>The W3C has chartered a <a href="http://www.w3.org/annotation/">Web Annotation Working Group</a> (WG) to &quot;define a generic data model for annotations, and        define the basic infrastructural elements to make it deployable in        browsers and reading systems through suitable user interfaces&quot;.  BIBFRFAME is following this work closely, and though it is a work in progress, BIBFRAME intends to develop its annotation specification as a profile of the W3C work. The WG has published a draft <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/">Data Model</a> and has prepared a draft <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-annotation/protocol/wd/">Protocol</a>. This document reflects both the W3C Data Model and the Protocol, and as such, is also a work in progress. BIBFRAME annotations will use the W3C Annotation Namespace <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa">http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#</a> whenever possible and practical, to express properties, classes, etc.  
              We use the prefix 'oa:' for this namespace. For example, annotations are members of the class oa:Annotation.</p>
            <p>The W3C annotation work is referred to as &quot;Web Annotations&quot;. Any BIBFRAME annotation will be a web annotation, however
            we'll use the term &quot;web annotation&quot; in this document specifically to refer to the W3C work.</p>

              <div class="subsection">
                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3>Expressing the &quot;aboutness&quot; of an Annotation</h3>
                  <p>An annotation is normally expressed for a reason. Web annotations refer to the reason as &quot;Motivation&quot;. There is a partial list of web annotation motivations at <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivations">http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivations</a>. For example, if an annotation expresses a comment, then the motivation is &quot;commenting&quot;.  To express this motivation, the annotation uses the property oa:motivatedBy, whose object, oa:commenting,  is an instance of class oa:Motivation. This is a subClass of skos:Concept which allows us to define broader and narrower motivations. Any of the motivations in this table may be used as the motivation for a BIBFRAME annotation. </p>
                  <p>BIBFRAME class bf:Motivation is defined, a subclass of oa:Motivation, and its instances are motivations necessary for BIBFRAME, not supported by web annotations.  Any external ontology is free to define a similar motivation class, for motivations that are not supported by web annotations or BIBFRAME. </p>
                  <h2>Annotation-Friendly Resources</h2>
                  <p>Essentially the reasons for this spec are to:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Provide the capability for users to annotate BIBFRAME resources.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that BIBFRAME annotations are compatible with web annotations.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that BIBFRAME resouces are Annotation-friendly.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>We deal here with the third of these purposes. &quot;Annotation-Friendly&quot; is a term coined by this specification (not web annotations), and while web annotations provides support for friendliness, it isn't a high priority.  A resource is &quot;annotation-friendly&quot; if it provides for a client to submit an annotation, and for a user to discover annotations for that resource. </p>
                  <p>The web annotation protocol (referenced above) provides a number of features and we will look at three here in particular: </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Party 1 creates a resource and makes it annotation-friendly</li>
                    <li>Party 2 annotates that resource</li>
                    <li>Party 3 finds annotations for that resource</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Making a resource &ldquo;Annotation-Friendly&rdquo;</h3>
                  <p>Sue creates a resource <a href="http://example.com%20/sues-resources/resource1">http://example.com  /sues-resources/resource1</a> .  <br />
                    She creates an annotation container for the resource: <a href="http://example.com%20/sues-resources/resource1/annotations/">http://example.com  /sues-resources/resource1/annotations/</a>   <br />
                  </p>
                  <p>Annotation containers are described in the web annotation protocol. For purposes of this specification, it is prescribed that when you create a resouce and you intend that it be annotation friendly, create a resource whose URI is &quot;annoations/&quot; appended to the URI of the resource to be annotated. </p>
                  <h3>Annotating the Resource</h3>
                  <p>Fred has created and wants to submit an annotation for <a href="http://example.com/%20sues-resources/resource1">http://example.com/  sues-resources/resource1</a>.   He posts  (via HTTP POST) the annotation to the container, <a href="http://example.com/sues-resources/resource1/annotations/">http://example.com/sues-resources/resource1/annotations/</a>  .  As a  result the server:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>Creates an annotation  resource.  </li>
                    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>Lists the URI of the  created annotation resource in the container. </li>
                    <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>Returns a  response which includes: </li>
                    <ol>
                      <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>The annotation as  submitted.</li>
                      <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>Additional information,  for example &ldquo;oa:annotatedAt&rdquo;  (time of annotation).</li>
                      <li><span dir="ltr"> </span>The URI of the created  annotation. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </ol>
                  <h3>Finding the Annotations</h3>
                  <p>Finally, Lydia, a researcher, discovers resource <a href="http://example.com%20/sues-resources/resource1">http://example.com /sues-resources/resource1</a> and wants to find  its annotations.  She does an HTTP GET  on <a href="http://example.com/sues-resources/resource1/annotations/">http://example.com/sues-resources/resource1/annotations/</a>, and the list of annotation URIs is provided. </p>
                  <p></p>
