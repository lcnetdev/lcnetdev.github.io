  <h1>2017 Revisions of Events Vocabulary  </h1>
 <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
  
  <p><em><strong>December 4th, 2017 Announcement </strong></em></p>
  
  <p>The PREMIS Editorial Committee has just released the recently revised set of <a href="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation/eventType.html">Preservation Event Type Controlled Vocabulary</a> via the <a href="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation.html">Library of Congress Linked Data Service (Preservation Schemes</a>). 26 new terms were added to the existing set of 16 terms, resulting in 42 total terms in the current set.
  


  
   <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
  
  
  <p><em><strong>August 30th, 2017 Announcement </strong></em></p>
  
  <p>The PREMIS Editorial Committee has  decided to revise the recently released <a href="v3/preservation-events.pdf">Preservation Events Controlled  Vocabulary (released in June 2017)</a>. 
This <a href="v3/preservation-events-revision1.pdf">August 2017 revision</a> amends a mix up in the  details of &ldquo;ingestion&rdquo; and &ldquo;dissemination&rdquo;, where SIPs and DIPs were referenced  wrongly. 
In addition, this revision takes note  of conversations in the PREMIS listserv around the &ldquo;modification&rdquo; event. The  original detail for this event explicitly stated that the &ldquo;event does not  create a new object&rdquo;. However, this is in opposition to the stated 1:1  principle of the PREMIS data dictionary, which states that &ldquo;[i]t is not  possible to change a file (or bitstream or representation); one can only create  a new file (or bitstream or representation) that is related to the source  Object&rdquo; [p.22]. On reflection, the Committee decided to change some of the  detail of that event in order to resolve that dissonance with the standard. The  new detail removes the requirement of working only on the original file. The  intent of the event is now that a new object is created. The institution can  decide whether or not (and how) to record that relationship between the  modified file and the original. &nbsp;As always, we are always keen  to continue discussions and are more than happy to answer any questions. See below for the changes.&nbsp; </p>

  <p><em><strong>June 29th, 2017 Announcement</strong></em></p>
  <p>The PREMIS Editorial Committee is delighted to announce the release of a new version of the controlled vocabulary for preservation events. 
    
    The list of events and descriptions are now available on the website [<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/preservation-events.pdf">http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/v3/preservation-events.pdf</a>].
    They will be made available on the Library of Congress linked data service shortly [<a href="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation.html">http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation.html</a>]. 
    Further documentation giving more context about the events and how they could be used will be posted to the PREMIS website in the coming weeks. 
    <ul>
  <li> What is it about? Preservation events are at the core of what we, as a professionals working in digital preservation, do. They are the indicators of the functions we undertake on digital objects in our care and are therefore key to ensuring the integrity of those objects. This version of the controlled vocabulary updates the existing list of 16 events.
<li>Why an updated version? The existing list was first generated in 2010 and last modified in 2012. A lot has happened since then including an increase in the number of organisations with experience in undertaking digital preservation activities and a shift in the depth of knowledge about these activities. This update takes advantage of these experiences and advances.
<li>What is covered? To be clear, this vocabulary of events does not cover all functions that a preservation repository will undertake. Such an undertaking would assume a homogeneity across institutions and systems. The digital preservation community is not yet at that stage. The vocabulary contains what we believe to be a strong representation of activities that a preservation programme could be undertaking. Local implementations should of course supplement the vocabulary with their own events where required. 
<li>Who was involved? The review was led by the PREMIS Editorial Committee. I would like to acknowledge the work of Lina Bountouri of the EU Publications Office who participated as a member of the working group. The review also benefitted immensely from input from individuals and institutions who offered expert advice and support at various stages.
<li>Further documentation giving more context about the events and how they could be used will be posted to the PREMIS website in the coming weeks.
