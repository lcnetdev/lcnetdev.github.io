  <p>This note describes the date/time definition included in the PREMIS
    schema: the problem/background, approach, requirements, analysis,&nbsp;solution,
    and future plans. </p>
  <h3>Problem/Background</h3>
  <p>There is no standard date/time format that meets the needs of  various
    well-known XML metadata schemas, for example MODS, METS, PREMIS, etc. </p>
  <p>W3C XML Schema built-in types xs:date and xs:datetime are inadequate. For
    example, the date 2001-02-03 is a valid xs:date value, but 20010203, without
    the hyphens, is not, even though it is a valid ISO 8601 date. This is a choice
    that W3C made when defining xs:date: the hyphenated form was chosen and the
    non-hyphenated form excluded. Similarly, for xs:dateTime, 2001-02-03T09:30:01
    is valid, but&nbsp; 2001-02-03T093001, without the colons in the time, is
    not (even thought it is a valid ISO 8601 date/time).&nbsp; And xs:date does
    not allow just the year and month (without the day), or just the year, or
    a date range (even though ISO 8601 supports all of these). </p>
  <p> Many dates are coded in database records without hyphens (and conformant
    with ISO 8601). It
    is a burden to have to insert hyphens when extracting a date from a database
    record to insert into an xml record and it should not be necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Times
    are often encoded without colons.&nbsp; Year/month (without the day) needs
    to be represented, as do date ranges.&nbsp; And there are additional requirements
    (discussed below) that extend even beyond ISO 8601. </p>
  <p> For many years there has been discussion
    of developing a reasonably comprehensive date/time definition to meet the
    needs of the bibliographic community, and submitting it either
    for standardization or some other mode of formalization (a W3C note for example,
    or a NISO Profile), and perhaps writing a schema as proof of concept.&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    a preliminary step, a fairly simple date/time definition
    has been developed for the PREMIS schema and is described below. This definition
    could be the starting point for a more general date/time standard. </p>
  <h3><strong>Approach</strong></h3>
  <p> The definition should be&nbsp;both a profile of and&nbsp; extension to
    ISO 8601.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li> A profile, because:
      <ul>
          <li>It would include relevant/necessary features of 8601 only, discarding
            unnecessary features; and </li>
        <li>It would prescribe these features in a manner compatible with 8601.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>An Extension, because:
      <ul>
          <li>It would not, strictly speaking, be a profile of 8601, since
            it would include features that are not in 8601.&nbsp; So in this sense
            it would extend 8601.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If this specification were to become popular and widely deployed, these
    extensions  might eventually be proposed to ISO for addition to 8601. By
    keeping the specification as compatible with 8601 as possible, 
    the likelihood is increased that the extensions would be taken seriously. </p>
  <p><strong>NOTE: </strong><i>There is an Internet Draft, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-temper-01">Temporal
    Enumerated Ranges (TEMPER)</a>, which addresses some of the same concerns.&nbsp; TEMPER
    was considered as a possible solution. However TEMPER  diverges considerably
    from ISO 8601, to the extent that a solution based on the approach outlined
    above, using TEMPER, is not possible.</i>&nbsp;This solution does use mechanisms
    similar to TEMPER where appropriate. </p>
  <h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3>
  <p> This is a partial list of known requirements; it is not claimed to be complete,
    but it is the set that the current draft schema addresses. </p>
  <ol>
    <li> The &quot;basic&quot; option in ISO 8601, i.e. YYYYMMDD without hyphens,
      and HHMMSS without colons. </li>
    <li>BCE dates.</li>
    <li>Time zones. </li>
    <li>Year and month only (no day of month), or year only.</li>
    <li>Questionable dates. E.g. 1992? would mean &quot;possibly&quot; the year
      1992, but not &quot;definitely&quot;.</li>
    <li>Approximate dates. E.g. 1992~ would mean &quot;approximately&quot; the
      year 1992.</li>
    <li>Uncertain dates. E.g. 199? would mean some year in the 1990s, but not
      certain which year; 1999-?? would mean some month in 1999, 199901?? would
      mean some day in the month of 1999-01)</li>
    <li>Date range (start and end).</li>
    <li>End date &ldquo;OPEN&rdquo; in a date range. </li>
    <li>Start and/or end date &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; in a date range. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
  <p>Requirement (1) is to allow raw data to be extracted and put into xml without
    conversion. It is not intended to subject all data to this requirement, only
    data that is typically encountered in database records that
    needs to be converted to XML (data that conforms to ISO 8601 but
    hyphens/colons are not included).&nbsp;For
    data where conversion is not an issue, and which is handled by xs:date or
    xs:dateTime, these two built-in types are preferred, because built-in validation
    is provided. </p>
  <p>For example, BCE dates (2) are not commonly found in bibliographic metadata,
    they are mostly original data, so conversion is not a major issue,
    and so representing them with hyphens is acceptable. The same holds for time
    zones (3). BCE dates and time zones are handled by xs:date and xs:dateTime,
    so neither need be treated by any special schema logic, they can be entered
    as xs:date and xs:dateTime.</p>
  <p>Year-and-month-only or year-only
    (4), although supported by ISO 8601, are not supported
    by xs:date. In fact  their use in conjuction
    with the additional requirements - questionable (5), approximate (6), or
    uncertain (7) dates - is not even supported by ISO 8601. </p>
  <p>Similarly,
    ISO 8601 supports ranges (8) though xs:date does not, and similarly, ISO
    does not support it in conjuction with the additional requirements: &quot;OPEN&quot; (9)
    and
    &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; (10). </p>
  <p>But none of these additional requirements, (4) through (7), apply
    to dateTime.&nbsp;&nbsp;  So a regular expression or pattern developed for
    date requirements will have very different features than one developed for
    date/time.&nbsp; And the special requirements for range don't apply to date
    or date/time. So one or more patterns for date, one or more for
    date/time, and one or more for range, are needed. </p>
  <p> The right number of patterns of course is a subjective design decision:
    one large complex pattern, or several smaller, simpler
    patterns. &nbsp;Too few patterns increase the complexity of each individual
    pattern. More patterns increases overall complexity.&nbsp; In any case, simplicity
    comes at the expense of decreased validation power. &nbsp;</p>
  <p>For this solution, two patterns for date, and one each for date/time and
    range are defined. This set of four patterns is combined as a union (xs:union)
    with xs:date and xs:dateTime.&nbsp;Thus any string validates if it conforms
    to one of these six types.</p>
  <h3>Patterns</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h5><b>patterns For Date </b></h5>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The key issue with dates is hyphens. </p>
    <p>ISO 8601 requires a hyphen for year-month (with no day). Hyphens are optional
      for year/month/day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that 8601 requires hyphens for
      year-month doesn't present a big problem, that is, with regard to requirement
      (1) because most if not all of the date data of concern (data for conversion)
      is of the form year/month/date. To be as compatible with 8601
      as possible, all dates of the form year-month will
      include the hyphen.&nbsp; For dates where the day is included, the form
      with no hyphens is accomodated; &quot;with hyphens&quot;
      is supported via xs:date so no special schema logic is needed. </p>
    <p>The two date patterns are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>year (yyyy) or year-month (yyyy-mm) where
        the last or last two digits of year may be '?' (199? means some year
        from 1990 to 1999; 19?? means some year
        from 1900 to 1999), or month may be '??' ( 2004-?? &quot;means some
        month in 2004&quot;), and the entire string may end with '?' or '~' for &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;approximate&quot;. <br />
      </li>
      <li>yearMonthDay - yyyymmdd, where 'day' may be
        '??' so '200412??' means &quot;some day during the month of 12/2004&quot;.  
        The whole string may be followed by '?' or '~' .          
        &nbsp;&nbsp; hyphens are not allowed for this pattern. Year-month-day
        with hyphens will validate via xs:date. It seems unnecessary to support
        year-month-date with hyphens along with the additional requirements;
        for year-month-date with the additional requirements the non-hyphen form
        should suffice.<br />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These two patterns (written in the XML schema pattern syntax) respectively
      are: </p>
    <p>&lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{2}(\d{2}|\?\?|\d(\d|\?))(-(\d{2}|\?\?))?~?\??&quot;/&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{6}(\d{2}|\?\?)~?\??&quot;/&gt;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><b>pattern For Time </b></h5>
  <p>One pattern is defined for date/time (with T separator):'yyyymmddThhmmss'.
    hyphens in date and colons in time are not allowed for this pattern. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The pattern is:<br />
      &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{8}T\d{6}&quot;/&gt; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h5><b>pattern For Range </b></h5>
  <p> One pattern is defined for range: for years - 'yyyy/yyyy'; for year/month
    - yyyy-mm/yyyy-mm. Beginning or end of range value may be 'UNKNOWN'. End
    of range value may be 'OPEN'. hyphens mandatory when month is present. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The pattern is:<br />
      &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;((\d{4}(-\d{2})?)|UNKNOWN)/((\d{4}(-\d{2})?)|UNKNOWN|OPEN)&quot;/&gt;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>None of these patterns  will provide more than rudimentary validation.&nbsp; They
    can enforce for example that the date has eight digits, the time has six
    digits, certain masking characters, the words &ldquo;OPEN&rdquo; or &ldquo;UNKNOWN&rdquo; in
    a range, but a pattern cannot validate&nbsp; (without excessive complexity)
    that the month is between 1 and 12 and the day between 1 and 31, much less
    that the day is consistent with the month (e.g.&nbsp; that if the month is
    04 then the day must be 30 or less), and so on. These are things that xs:date
    does very well.&nbsp; So xs:date and xs:dateTime should be used whenever
    none of the special features is needed that these do not support. </p>
  <h3> Solution</h3>
  <p> The schema fragment shown below is part of the  Premis 2.0 schema.&nbsp; The
    date/time definition is named the &quot;Extended Date/Time Format&quot; , EDTF.&nbsp;The
    schema defines a simple type:edtfSimpleType. Any element that encodes date
    or date/time data is assigned this type. This means it can be encoded according
    to any of the simple types which comprise the union that defines edtfSimpleType;
    that is, it may be encoded as xs:date, xs:dateTime, or as any of the four patterns
    defined by the simple type edtfRegularExpressions.</p>
  <table width="901" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td width="891" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><p>***********************************date/time
        Definition ****************</p>
         
        <p>Extended Date/Time Format: edtf</p>
        <p>************************* edtfSimpleType</p>
        <p>edtfSimpleType is the union of three simple types - xsDate, xs:dateTime,
          and edtfRegularExpressions. (&quot;union&quot; means that any string
          conforming to any one of the types in the union will validate.) xs:date
          and xs:dateTime are built-in W3Cschema types. edtfRegularExpressions
          is a set of four regular expressions which are described below. So any
          string that conforms to one of the two built-in types or any of the four
          regular expressions will validate. <br />
          --&gt;<br />
          &lt;xs:simpleType name=&quot;edtfSimpleType&quot;&gt;<br />
          &lt;xs:union memberTypes=&quot;xs:date xs:dateTime edtfRegularExpressions&quot;/&gt;<br />

          &lt;xs:restriction base=&quot;xs:string&quot;&gt;<br />
          &lt;!-- <br />
          The following pattern is for year (yyyy) or year-month (yyyy-mm) <br />
          The last or last two digits of year may be '?' meaning &quot;one year
          in that range but not sure which year&quot;, for example 19?? means some
          year from 1990 to 1999. Similarly month may be '??' so that 2004-?? &quot;means
          some month in 2004&quot;. And the entire string may end with '?' or '~'
          for &quot;uncertain&quot; or &quot;approximate&quot;.<br />
          Hyphen must separate year and month.<br />
          --&gt;<br />
          &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{2}(\d{2}|\?\?|\d(\d|\?))(-(\d{2}|\?\?))?~?\??&quot;/&gt;<br />
          &lt;!-- <br />
          The following pattern is for yearMonthDay - yyyymmdd, where 'dd' may
          be '??' so '200412??' means &quot;some day during the month of 12/2004&quot;. <br />
          The whole string may be followed by '?' or '~' to mean &quot;questionable&quot; or &quot;approximate&quot;.
          hyphens are not allowed for this pattern. <br />
          --&gt;<br />
          &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{6}(\d{2}|\?\?)~?\??&quot;/&gt;<br />
          &lt;!-- </p>
        <p>The following pattern is for date and time with T separator:'yyyymmddThhmmss'. <br />
          hyphens in date and colons in time not allowed for this pattern. <br />
          --&gt;<br />
          &lt;xs:pattern value=&quot;\d{8}T\d{6}&quot;/&gt;<br />
          &lt;!-- </p>
        <p>The following pattern is for a date range. in years: 'yyyy/yyyy'; or
          year/month: yyyy-mm/yyyy-mm. Beginning or end of range value may be 'UNKNOWN'.
          End of range value may be 'OPEN'.<br />
          hyphens mandatory when month is present. <br />

  <h3><strong> Future Plans</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong> </h3>
  <p>For now, this approach is suggested for PREMIS, and can benefit from further
    development within the PREMIS community and other communities.&nbsp; Currently
    it is written inline, in the PREMIS schema.  Once the definition
    matures it could be incorporated into other schemas,
    for example, MODS.&nbsp; At that point it could become a utility schema maintained
    by LC and referenced externally by PREMIS and MODS.
    At some point it may be proposed for standardization,
    perhaps within a future version of ISO 8601, and perhaps even proposed to W3C
    for adoption as an XML schema type &ndash; the benefits of
    this are clear, among them: strict validation would be supported.
