      <h1>MARC XML Design Considerations</h1>
      The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office is
      developing a <A href="marcxml-architecture.html">framework</A> for working with MARC data in a XML environment.
      This framework is intended to be flexible and extensible to allow users
      to work with MARC data in ways specific to their needs. The framework will
      contain many components such as schemas, stylesheets, and software tools
      developed and maintained by the Library of Congress.
      <p><b>1. Simple and Flexible MARC XML Schema</b></p>
      <p>The core of the MARC XML framework is a simple XML schema which contains
        MARC data. This base schema output can be used where full MARC records
        are needed or act as a "bus" to enable MARC data records to go through
        further transformations such as toDublin Core and/or processes such as
        validation. The MARC XML schema will not need to be edited to reflect
        minor changes to MARC21. The schema retains the semantics of MARC.</p>
      <p>All control fields, including the leader are treated as a data string.
        Fields are treated as elements with the tag as an attribute and indicators
        treated as attributes. Subfields are treated as subelements with the subfield
        code as an attribute.</p>
      <p><b>2. Lossless Conversion of MARC to XML</b></p>
      <p>All of the essential data in a MARC record is converted and expressed
        in XML. MARC structrual elements, such as the length of field and starting
        position of field data in directory entries are not needed in the XML
        record. Leader data positions not needed in the XML environment are
        retained as place holders or carried as blanks.</p>
      <p><b>3. Roundtripability from XML back to MARC</b></p>
      <p>As a consequence of the lossless conversion from MARC (2709), information
        in a MARC XML record enables recreation of a MARC (2709) record without
        loss of data. A MARC (2709) record can also be created without data loss
        from MARC XML records.</p>
      <p><b>4. Data Presentation</b></p>
      <p>Once MARC data has been converted to XML, data presentation is possible
        by writing a XML stylesheet to select the MARC elements to be displayed
        and to apply the appropriate markup.</p>
      <P>
      <p><b>5. MARC Editing</b></p>
      <p>Some single or batch updates such as adding, updating, or deleting a
        field to a MARC record can be accomplished with simple XML transformations</p>
      <P>
      <p><b>6. Data Conversion</b></p>
      <p>Most data conversions can be written as XML transformations. For more
        complex transformations of the data, software tools which read MARC XML
        can be written. </p>
      <P>
      <p><b>7. Validation of MARC data</b></p>
      <p>Validation with this schema is accomplished via a software tool. This
        software, external to the schema, will provide three possible levels of
        validation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic XML validation according to the MARC XML Schema</li>
        <li>Validation of MARC21 tagging (field and subfield)</li>
        <li>Validation of MARC record content, e.g., coded values, dates, and
          times.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>8. Extensiblity</b>
      <p>By using XML as the structure for MARC records, users of the MARC in
        the XML framework can more easily write their own tools to consume, manipulate,
        and convert MARC data.</p>
