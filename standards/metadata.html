<center><b>INTRODUCTION TO THE TABLE</b></center>
        <p> <b>Purpose:</b> Identification of a core set of metadata elements to be used 
          in the development, testing, and implementation of multiple repositories. 
        <p><a NAME="background"><b>Background: </b></a>With a charter from the
           Digital Futures Group at the Library of Congress, representatives
          from 
          Library Services, ITS and the National Digital Library Program drafted
           this list of elements drawing on previous work contained in <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/techdocs/repository/structmeta.html">Structural
            Metadata Dictionary for LC Digitized Material</a>, version 1.03,
            and 
        
		 Metadata Table for the Coolidge-Consumerism Experiment,
		 
		
		 and on experience with the Thomson Editorial Asset Management System
		 (TEAMS) repository proof-of-concept project, December 1998-April 1999.
		 After broader discussion
          and comment during summer 1999, some nomenclature was modified, elements
		 for audio-visual objects were added to the list and a distinction was
          made between information necessary for digital preservation and for
		 digital reformatting. An application of the core metadata elements for 
          <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/mopic/avprot/avlcdocs.html#md">audio
           visual materials</a> is currently in development as part of the Audio
            Visual Preservation Digital Prototyping Project. 
        <p><a NAME="types"><b>Types of Metadata:</b></a> Metadata elements listed 
          in the table are categorized according to three types: descriptive, 
          administrative, and structural. Administrative metadata is used for 
          managing and preserving objects in the repository; structural metadata 
          is used primarily for storage of objects in a repository and for presentation; 
          descriptive metadata is used for discovery of objects. The elements 
          defined in this table are to support structural and administrative functions. 
          Functions served are access management, administration, discovery, persistent 
          identifier, presentation, digital preservation and preservation reformatting. 
        <p>The Library intends to maintain the fullest descriptive metadata in 
          its main catalog. Experiences with the Coolidge-Consumerism experiment 
          and the TEAMS prototype, however, indicate that some descriptive information 
          is helpful for administration of metadata and presentation of content. 
          Consquently, five descriptive elements are included in the Table of 
          Core Metadata Elements. 
        <p><a NAME="levels"> <b>Metadata Levels:</b></a> A hierarchy of information 
          is proposed to accommodate the diversity of digital objects and to propagate 
          data with some efficiency. Metadata elements may be supplied at multiple 
          and various levels. Nesting of objects is expected and will be further 
          clarified during the pilot phase of metadata capture and deposit. Information 
          may be inherited from parent levels or may be specific to single objects 
          at a lower level. For example, a collection may have general access 
          rights but some of its items may be restricted. The access_rights attribute 
          value on the collection (set or aggregate level) may be "public," but 
          a single title(primary object level) in the collection may be "restricted." 
        <p>The levels of metadata are
        <ul>
          <li><b>Set - </b>Set-level metadata applies to what is currently known 
            as a digital collection, e.g<i>. Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers</i>. 
            Digital collections are formed from aggregates that group digital 
            items by original content type, such as non-motion visual, text, motion 
            visual, or audio; and by custodial responsibility as well as by collection. 
            A collection may be determined from an archival series or from a topical 
            bibliography. Some digital collections are contained within a single 
            aggregate. Others are formed by numerous aggregates. Set-level metadata 
            applies to all aggregates within the set regardless of content or 
            responsibility.</li>
          <li> <b>Aggregate</b> - An aggregate organizes digital objects by digital 
            type and by digital custodial responsibility. A single aggregate may 
            be a digital collection. Aggregate-level metadata applies to all primary 
            objects within an aggregate.</li>
          <li> <b>Primary Object - </b>The specific item identified by the online 
            collection access aid as a coherent whole is known as the primary 
            object. Primary objects are usually the digital equivalents of physical 
            library items, such as a book, a sound recording, a movie, a single 
            title of sheet music, a folder of letters, a photograph, or a map. 
            This level metadata applies to all the intermediate and terminal objects 
            of a particular primary object.</li>
          <li> <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Object - </b>The intermediate object is 
            a view or component of the primary object. A book that can be presented 
            as page images or as searchable text has two intermediate objects. 
            One points to all the page images of the book, the other to an encoded 
            text file. Complex primary objects such as sound recordings offer 
            many intermediate object possibilities. Multiple sides or tracks for 
            a recording, each with sound and label components, may be captured 
            in several formats. A single78 rpm record with two sides will have 
            several audio files in both streaming and higher resolution formats, 
            as well as the image and text of the label for each side and the jacket 
            or album cover.&nbsp; Metadata for an intermediate object allows the 
            gathering of digital files and metadata for the creation of presentations.</li>
          <li> <b>Terminal Object - </b>The terminal object is the digital content 
            file or files that form the object. There is at least one terminal 
            for each object. Terminal object-level metadata is primarily structural 
            supplying the digital attributes of each file such as size, extension, 
            bit-depth, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <a NAME="table"><b>Table of Elements: </b></a>The <a href="metable.html">Table 
        of Core Metadata Elements</a> for Library of Congress Digital Repository 
        Development is arranged in alphabetical order and includes the following 
        fields: 
        <ul>
          <li> <b><i>Name</i></b> is the label for the metadata element. Names 
            are intended to be easily comprehended and unambiguous.</li>
          <li> <b><i>Definition</i></b> is a brief description of the information 
            contained in the element.</li>
          <li> <b><i>Function</i></b> is an indicator of how the element is used. 
            Functions served by metadata elements are access management, administration, 
            discovery, persistent identifier, presentation, digital preservation 
            and preservation reformatting. Preservation (D) signifies digital 
            preservation and preservation (R) indicates preservation reformatting.</li>
          <li> <b><i>Type</i></b> is an indicator of the functions the metadata 
            is intended to support.</li>
          <li> <b><i>Use</i></b> is an indicator of frequency and requirement 
            of the element.</li>
          <li> <b><i>Level </i></b>is an indicator of position within the repository 
            hierarchy that the element is meaningful.</li>
        </ul>

        of data gathered for a letter from the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/bellhtml/bellhome.html">Alexander

        readily available for objects currently created, stored and delivered 
        through the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/">American Memory</a> interface 
        at the Library of Congress. Values entered into the table are examples 
        of the type of information that could appear in the field. Actual data 
        types and value tables will be defined and refined as part of several 
        pilot projects initiated in autumn 1999. <BR>
