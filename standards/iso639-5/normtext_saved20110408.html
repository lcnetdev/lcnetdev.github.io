<h1>Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages<br />
  Part 5: Alpha-3 code for language families and groups </h1>
      <!-- #BeginEditable "content" --> 
	  <h2>Normative Text </h2>
	  <h3 align="center">1 Scope </h3>
	  <p>This part of ISO&nbsp;639 provides a code
	    consisting of language code elements comprising three-letter language identifiers
	    for the representation of names of living and extinct language families
	    and groups. Languages designed exclusively for machine use, such as computer-programming
	    languages, are not included in this code.</p>
	  <h3 align="center">2 Normative references </h3>
	  <p>The following referenced documents are
	    indispensable for the application of this document. For dated references,
	    only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition
	    of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.</p>
	  <p><a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">ISO&nbsp;639-2:1998, <em>Codes
	        for the representation of names of languages &mdash; Part 2: Alpha-3 code</em></a><em></em></p>
	  <h3 align="center">3 Term and definitions </h3>
	  <p>For the purposes of this document, the
	    following terms and definitions apply.</p>
	  <p><strong>3.1 code</strong><br />
  data transformed or represented in different forms according to a pre-established
    set of rules </p>
	  <p><strong>3.2 code element</strong><br />
  individual entry in a <strong>code</strong> (3.1)<br />
  NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp; In the language code in this part of ISO&nbsp;639,
  each code element consists of a language identifier and the names of the language
  family or group. </p>
	  <p><strong>3.3 language identifier; language symbol</strong><br />
  string of letters assigned to a linguistic unit for the purpose of uniquely
    representing it<br />
  NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp; In the language <strong>code</strong> (3.1)
  in this part of ISO&nbsp;639, each language identifier is composed of three letters. </p>
	  <p><strong>3.4<br />
  individual language</strong><br />
  language that is distinctly different from another language </p>
	  <p><strong>3.5<br />
  language family</strong><br />
  two or more <strong>individual languages</strong> (3.4)
  that are related to each other through having common ancestry<br />
  NOTE&nbsp;&nbsp; In exceptional cases a language family
  may have only one individual language as a member. </p>
	  <p><strong>3.6<br />
  language group</strong><br />
  two or more <strong>individual languages</strong> (3.4)
  that, for some purpose, may suitably be treated as a unit </p>
	  <p><strong>3.7<br />
  remainder group</strong><br />
  <strong>language group</strong> (3.6) with
  the explicit exclusion of specified languages<br />
  NOTE&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
  ISO&nbsp;639-2, a typical example of a remainder group is &ldquo;gem&rdquo; = &ldquo;Germanic (Other)&rdquo;, which has the extension of all languages and language groups belonging to the
  Germanic language family with the exception of all individual languages and
  language groups within that family that have separate identifiers in ISO&nbsp;639-2.<br />
  NOTE&nbsp;2 See 4.2. </p>
	  <h3 align="center">4 Application issues</h3>
	  <h4 align="center"><strong>4.1 Alpha-3 language
	      coding code space</strong></h4>
	  <p>The totality of language identifiers encoded
	    in all parts of ISO&nbsp;639 constitutes one common code space. Each language identifier is uniquely defined
	    and has one intension only. (See 4.2 for a special case.) </p>
	  <h4 align="center">4.2 Language identifiers that are
	    also included in ISO&nbsp;639-2</h4>
	  <p>ISO&nbsp;639-2 contains a number
	    of language identifiers that denote <strong>language families</strong> (3.5) or <strong>language groups </strong>(3.6). Some of these identifiers denote the entire family or group, while other
	    identifiers are intended to denote any language (or a text or document in
	    a language) within a language family or language group that does not have
	    a specific language identifier as an individual language in ISO&nbsp;639-2. These items are referred to as <strong>remainder groups</strong> (3.7).</p>
	  <p>Items that are remainder groups in ISO&nbsp;639-2
	    have been renamed in this part of ISO&nbsp;639 to conform to the naming convention of other families and groups, normally
	    by changing &ldquo;(other)&rdquo; to &ldquo;languages&rdquo; in English, and by deleting the word &ldquo;autres&rdquo; in French. These items are identified with the letter &ldquo;r&rdquo; in the &ldquo;639-2&rdquo; column of the tables. See Annex&nbsp;A for a separate list of these items as included in ISO&nbsp;639-2.</p>
	  <p>There are currently 55 items that are
	    included in both ISO&nbsp;639-2 and this part of ISO&nbsp;639. Of these items, 20 items are identical in the two parts (e.g.&nbsp;&ldquo;alg &ndash; Algonquian languages&rdquo;). The remaining 35&nbsp;items are intended to cover remainder groups in ISO 639-2 and entire language
	    groups in this part of ISO&nbsp;639 (e.g. &ldquo;afa &ndash; Afro-Asiatic (Other)&rdquo; in ISO&nbsp;639-2 and &ldquo;afa &ndash; Afro-Asiatic languages&rdquo; in this part of ISO&nbsp;639). </p>
	  <p>According to the principles of ISO&nbsp;639-2,
	    the identifier &ldquo;afa&rdquo; will be assigned only to a document or information in (or about) an Afro-Asiatic
	    language that does not have an individual-language identifier in Part&nbsp;2, <u>and</u> that does not fall into the remainder groups &ldquo;ber &ndash; Berber (Other)&rdquo;, &ldquo;cus &ndash; Cushitic (Other)&rdquo;, or &ldquo;sem &ndash; Semitic (Other)&rdquo;, all of which are Afro-Asiatic language groups.</p>
	  <p>According to the principles of this part
	    of ISO&nbsp;639, the identifier &ldquo;afa&rdquo; may be assigned to a document or information in (or about) any Afro-Asiatic
	    language. The use of &ldquo;afa&rdquo;, &ldquo;sem&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ara&rdquo; in a concrete case relating to Arabic, depends on the purpose of the encoding,
	    as specified in the implementation.</p>
	  <p>The use of identifiers from this part
	    of ISO&nbsp;639 will depend on the purpose of the application. It is expected that user-defined
	    subsets of the items in this part of ISO&nbsp;639 will frequently be used in combination with, for example, the totality or
	    defined subsets of ISO&nbsp;639-2 or ISO&nbsp;639-3.</p>
	  <h4 align="center">4.3 Usage examples</h4>
	  <p>The difference between an item as encoded
	    in ISO&nbsp;639-2 [e.g. &ldquo;gem: Germanic (Other)&rdquo;] and as encoded in this part of ISO&nbsp;639 (e.g. &ldquo;gem: Germanic languages&rdquo;) is considered an implementational issue.</p>
	  <p>Typical applications of the encoding of this part of ISO&nbsp;639
	    include:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li> encoding of linguistic items that relate to language
          families or groups rather than to individual languages;</li>
        <li> identification of language families or groups that
          are the objects of discussion in scientific texts or documents;</li>
        <li>retrieval of items that are encoded with language identifiers
          denoting several individual languages constituting a language family
          or group. </li>
      </ul>
	  <h3 align="center">5 Maintenance of this language code</h3>
	  <p>No separate organizational structure for
	    the maintenance of this part of ISO&nbsp;639 is established.</p>
	  <p>The Registration Authority responsible
	    for the maintenance of ISO&nbsp;639-2, the Library of Congress, will also be responsible for the maintenance
	    of this part of ISO&nbsp;639.</p>
	  <p>The procedural rules that are given in
	    ISO&nbsp;639&#8209;2:1998 (4.2 and Annex&nbsp;A) apply to this part of ISO&nbsp;639.</p>
	  <h3 align="center">6 Language families and groups</h3>
	  <p>Tables&nbsp;1 to 4 contain
	    a list of language families and groups. The items that are included in ISO&nbsp;639-2 have retained their alpha-3 identifier from ISO&nbsp;639&#8209;2. Other items have been assigned new alpha-3 identifiers that are not used (and
	    will not be used) for any other item in the ISO&nbsp;639 series of International Standards.</p>
	  <p>The following tables are included:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li> Table&nbsp;1, ordered by English name;</li>
        <li> Table&nbsp;2, ordered by French name;</li>
        <li> Table&nbsp;3, ordered by identifier; and</li>
        <li>Table&nbsp;4, ordered by hierarchy. </li>
      </ul>
	  <p>All tables have the following columns:</p>
	  <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;English name&rdquo;;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;French name&rdquo;;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Ident&rdquo;, being the language
          identifier assigned to the language family or group;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;639-2&rdquo;, with one of
          the letters &ldquo;g&rdquo; or &ldquo;r&rdquo; indicating that the language family or group is included in ISO&nbsp;639-2 as a group (&ldquo;g&rdquo;) or a remainder group (&ldquo;r&rdquo;); see 4.2 and Annex&nbsp;A;</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Hierarchy&rdquo;, being
          an indication of which other language families or groups the current
          language family or group is a member of; and</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Notes&rdquo;, referring to
          table notes at the end of Table&nbsp;1. </li>
      </ul>
