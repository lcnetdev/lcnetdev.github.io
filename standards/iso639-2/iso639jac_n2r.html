      The following documents rules of procedure for the conduct of meetings and 
      email business by the ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee. It repeats some 
      information that is in ISO 639-2:1998 in the normative Annex A and elaborates 
      where necessary for clarification of procedures. In particular it details 
      how business is run in the absence of regular meetings. 
      <p> 
      <hr>
      <p> 
      <h3><b>1. Composition of the Joint Advisory Committee</b></h3>
      <p> ISO 639/JAC is composed of: 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>one representative of the International Information Centre for Terminology 
          (Infoterm; representing ISO 639-1/RA) 
        <li>one representative of the Library of Congress (LC; representing ISO 
          639-2/RA) 
        <li>three representatives of ISO/TC 37 (nominated by ISO/TC 37) 
        <li>three representatives of ISO/TC 46 (nominated by ISO/TC46) 
      </ul>
      <p> Both ISO/TCs may nominate substitute representatives for a meeting. 
      <p> 
      <h3><b>2. Membership of ISO 639/JAC</b></h3>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Representatives of Infoterm and Library of Congress will hold the 
          chair on a 2-year rotating basis. The first term begins at the first 
          meeting in February 2000. 
        <li>Up to six technical experts may be asked to participate as non-voting 
          observers. Each TC (TC37 and TC46) may appoint three observers based 
          on the issues and topics being discussed. 
        <li>Representatives may be reappointed or replaced if necessary by the 
          appropriate TC. Observers may be replaced by the appropriate rotating 
          chair. 
      </ul>
      <p> 
      <h3><b>3. Procedures for conducting business at meetings</b></h3>
      <p><i>3.1. Agenda.</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>An agenda will be distributed at least two months prior to the meeting. 
          It will be amended as needed when meeting is convened if there is agreement. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>3.2. Voting.</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Each member of ISO 639/JAC has one vote. 
        <li>Voting is obligatory. 
        <li>A vote must be unanimous for approval of an item. If there are abstentions, 
          it shall not be considered unanimous approval. 
        <li>If a unanimous vote cannot be reached on an item, a second vote will 
          be conducted following discussion. 
        <li>At least five positive votes are required to pass on the second ballot. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>3.3. Role of observers</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>The designated observers may attend a JAC meeting. No more than three 
          observers from each TC may attend. 
        <li>Observers shall function as experts concerning specific language issues, 
          not for procedural issues. 
        <li>Observers will be asked to contribute as necessary. 
        <li>Observers may not vote. 
        <li>Experts on specific topics may attend future meetings if appropriate 
          as determined by the chair. 
      </ul>
      <h3><b>4. Procedures for conducting business by electronic mail</b></h3>
      <i>4.1. Electronic communications</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>An electronic distribution list will include all ISO 639/JAC members 
          and appointed observers. 
        <li>Numbered documents are distributed by the chair. They may be distributed 
          to the JAC list (JAC members and observers) or more widely depending 
          upon the topic. 
        <li>The two rotating chairs may wish to consult on the appropriate distribution 
          for official committee documents. 
        <li>The more general list (iso639@dkuug.dk) may be used for discussion 
          about general or specific language issues. 
        <li>Prior to voting on specific changes new proposals should be openly 
          discussed on language-related lists. 
        <li>The chair may ask specific experts about specific language issues 
          as necessary. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>4.2. Electronic voting procedures</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Voting may take place electronically on the list initially and confirmed 
          in writing. A printed record will be kept. 
        <li>Votes must be submitted within two weeks of the electronic distribution 
          of the voting request. 
        <li>In some circumstances the voting period may be extended if necessary 
          because of complex issues; in these cases the deadline will be stated 
          when the voting request is distributed. 
        <li>Failure to vote is considered an abstention (and thus a unanimous 
          ballot cannot be reached with an abstention). 
        <li>If a JAC member does not vote after two consecutive times, the JAC 
          chair will inform the appropriate TC subcommittee and request a replacement. 
      </ul>
      <p><i>4.3. Role of observers</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>Observers will be included in electronic mail distributions when specific 
          language issues are discussed and their expertise is needed. 
        <li>Observers may be requested to perform research on specific language 
          issues when needed. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>4.4. Deadlines for response</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>When a request for a new, deleted, or changed code is submitted to 
          the appropriate Registration Authority (Infoterm for 639-1 and Library 
          of Congress for 639-2), the RA determines whether or not the request 
          meets the relevant criteria. 
        <li>The appropriate RA informs the requestor of the process generally 
          within two weeks of the submission. 
        <li>If the request meets the criteria, the RA determines an appropriate 
          code and consults the ISO 639/JAC. 
        <li>ISO 639/JAC is obliged to respond within one month with a decision. 
          This allows for a second round of voting if the first vote is not unanimous. 
        <li>The original requestor shall be informed of the JAC decision in six 
          weeks to two months from submission of the original request. 
        <li>Results of the JAC decisions will be publicized in a newsletter available 
          on the Web and distributed through distribution lists. 
      </ul>
