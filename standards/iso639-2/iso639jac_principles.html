      The following documents working principles for the maintenance of language 
      codes by the ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee. This primarily deals with 
      ISO 639-2; members of the JAC representing ISO 639-1 may consider adding 
      information about that standard. It repeats some information that is in 
      ISO 639-2:1998 in section 4 (Language codes) and the normative Annex A. 
      In addition, it gives further details as to how language code changes that 
      are submitted are considered and how the two parts of ISO 639 are related. 
      <b>Note that this is currently a draft for discussion by the ISO 639/JAC.</b>

      <h3><b>1. Definition of new language codes (ISO 639-2)</b></h3>
      <p><b>1.1. Procedures</b> 
      <ul>
        <li>A registration form will be available on the Web for requesting new 
          language codes. It shall be submitted to the ISO 639-2/RA for consideration. 
        <li>The Registration Authority will review applications, obtain additional 
          information and/or justification from the submitter, and suggest the 
          assignment of a code when the relevant criteria are met. 
      </ul>
      <p> <b>1.2. Criteria</b> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li><i>Number of documents. </i>The request for a new language code must 
          include evidence that one agency holds 50 different documents in the 
          language or that five agencies hold a total of 50 different documents 
          among them in the language. 
        <li><i>Collective codes. </i>If the criteria above is not met the language 
          may be assigned a collective language code. The words <i>languages</i> 
          or <i>other</i> as part of a language name indicates that a language 
          code is a collective one. 
        <li><i>Scripts.</i> A single language code is normally provided for a 
          language even though the language is written in more than one script. 
          A standard for scripts is under development by ISO/TC46/SC2, ISO CD 
          15924: <i>Codes for representation of names of scripts</i>. 
        <li><i>Dialects.</i>A dialect of a language is usually represented by 
          the same language code as that used for the language. If the language 
          is assigned to a collective language code, the dialect is assigned to 
          the same collective language code. 
      </ul>
      <h3><b>2. Choice of new language codes</b></h3>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Language codes consist of three Latin-alphabet characters in lowercase 
          with no diacritical marks or modified characters. 
        <li>Codes should not be intended to be abbreviations for the language, 
          but to serve as a device to identify a given language or group of languages. 
        <li>The language code is usually derived from the language name. 
        <li>There are 23 language names in ISO 639-2 that have variant codes, 
          one for bibliographic applications, the other for terminological applications. 
          This was because of established usage in national and international 
          bibliographic databases of codes based on English language forms of 
          names. 
        <li>New language codes will be based on the vernacular form of the language 
          unless another language code is requested by the country or countries 
          using the language or if the vernacular cannot be determined. In the 
          latter case, an English form of name may be used for the basis of the 
          language code. 
        <li>A language code already in ISO 639-2/T that is based on English form 
          of name shall not be changed even if the vernacular form is determined 
          and/or added to ISO 639-1. This is to ensure continuity and stability 
          and to minimize the number of languages with alternative codes. 
        <li>If a language name includes a prefix, that prefix is not considered 
          part of the language name (e.g. Herero is language name; "otshiherero" 
          is often used, but "otshi" means language; code is based on "herero"). 
      </ul>
      <h3><b>3. Changes of existing language codes</b></h3>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>To ensure continuity and stability in support of online retrieval 
          from large databases built over many years, codes should generally not 
          be changed, and if so only for compelling reasons. 
        <li>If a code is changed, the old code may not be reassigned for at least 
          five years. 
        <li>Language codes are not changed if the language changes its name. However, 
          language names associated with codes may be changed. 
      </ul>
      <p> 
      <h3><b>4. Relationship between ISO 639-1 to ISO 639-2 </b></h3>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>In development of ISO 639-2 there was a principle that any code in 
          the 3-character list would include the 2 characters from the 2-character 
          list unless this is impossible. An exception was the alternative codes, 
          where existing usage of bibliographic codes did not make this practical. 
        <li>New codes introduced in ISO 639-1 should follow this principle wherever 
          possible. If the vernacular form had not been used in ISO 639-2/T, the 
          639-1 code may diverge if necessary. 
        <li>The criteria for the inclusion of new language codes in ISO 639-1 
          will be clarified. Future development also needs to be considered, since 
          there is a limited number of letter combinations. 
        <li>ISO 639-1 shall remain a subset of ISO 639-2. (<b>discussion needed 
          on this!)</b> 
      </ul>
