      <h1>Codes for the <br>
        Representation of Names<br>
        of Languages-Part 2:<br>
        Alpha-3 Code</h1>
      <hr>
      <a name="top"></a>
      <h2>Normative Text</h2>
      <h3>1 Scope</h3>
      <p>This part of ISO 639 provides two sets of three-letter alphabetic codes
        for the representation of names of languages, one for terminology applications
        and the other for bibliographic applications. The code sets are the same
        except for twenty-three languages that have variant language codes because
        of the criteria used for formulating them (see <a href="#form_lang">4.1</a>).
        The language codes were devised originally for use by libraries, information
        services, and publishers to indicate language in the exchange of information,
        especially in computerized systems. These codes have been widely used
        in the library community and may be adopted for any application requiring
        the expression of language in coded form by terminologists and lexicographers.
        The alpha-3 code set was devised for practical use for most of the major
        languages of the world that are most frequently represented in the total
        body of the world's literature. Additional language codes are created
        when it becomes apparent that a significant body of literature in a particular
        language exists. Languages designed exclusively for machine use, such
        as computer programming languages, are not included in this code. </p>
      <h3>2 Normative reference</h3>
      <p>The following standard contains provisions which, through reference
        in this text, constitute provisions of this part of ISO 639. At the time
        of publication, the edition indicated was valid. All standards are subject
        to revision, and parties to agreements based on this part of ISO 639
        are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent
        edition of the standard indicated below. Members of IEC and ISO maintain
        registers of currently valid International Standards. </p>
      <p> <strong>ISO 3166-1:1997, Codes for the representation of names of countries
          and their subdivisions-Part 1: Country codes</strong>. </p>
      <h3>3 Definitions</h3>
      For the purpose of this part of ISO 639, the following definitions apply:
      <p> <strong>3.1<br>
        code </strong><br>
        data representation in different forms according to a pre-established
        set of rules </p>
      <p> <strong>3.2<br>
        language code</strong><br>
        combination of characters used to represent a language or languages </p>
      <p> <strong>3.3<br>
        collective language code</strong><br>
        language code used to represent a group of languages </p>
      <h3> Language codes</h3>
      <h4>4.1 <a name="form_lang">Form of the language codes</a></h4>
      <p>The language codes consist of three Latin-alphabet characters in lowercase.
        No diacritical marks or modified characters are used. Implementors should
        be aware that these codes are not intended to be an abbreviation for
        the language, but to serve as a device to identify a given language or
        group of languages. The language codes are derived from the language
        name.
      <p> Two code sets are provided, one for bibliographic applications (ISO
        639-2/B), and one for terminology applications (ISO 639-2/T). Criteria
        for selecting the form of a language code for code set B were: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> preference of the countries using the language </li>
        <li>established usage of codes in national and international bibliographic
          databases, and </li>
        <li>the vernacular or English form of the language. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Code set T was based on: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> the vernacular form of the language, or </li>
        <li>preference of the countries using the language. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are twenty-three language names that have variant codes assigned
        depending on the code set chosen. </p>
      <p> Future development of language codes will be based whenever possible
        on the vernacular form of the language, unless another language code
        is requested by the country or countries using the language. </p>
      <p> The bibliographic or terminology code set must be used in its entirety,
        and the choice of the set used must be made clear by exchanging partners
        prior to information interchange. Users shall refer to ISO 639-2/B for
        the code set for bibliographic applications and ISO 639-2/T for the code
        set for terminology applications. </p>
      <p> To ensure continuity and stability, codes shall only be changed for
        compelling reasons. After a change in codes, the previous code shall
        not be reassigned for at least five years.To accommodate large applications
        that build continuously, the codes in ISO 639-2/B shall not be changed
        if a language name or its abbreviation are changed. </p>
      <p> When adapting this part of ISO 639 to languages using other alphabets
        (e. g. Cyrillic), codes shall be formed according to the principles of
        this part of ISO 639. </p>
      <h4>4.1.1 Collective language codes</h4>
      <p>Collective language codes are provided for languages where a relatively
        small number of documents exist or are expected to be written, recorded
        or created. The words <em>languages</em> or <em>(other)</em> as part
        of a language name in the following tables may be taken to indicate that
        a language code is a collective language code. A collective language
        code is not intended to be used when an individual language code or another
        more specific collective language code is available. </p>
      <h4>4.1.2 Special situations</h4>
      <p>The language code <em>mul</em> (for <em>multiple languages</em>) should
        be applied when several languages are used and it is not practical to
        specify all the appropriate language codes. </p>
      <p> The language code <em>und</em> (for <em>undetermined</em>) is provided
        for those situations in which a language or languages must be indicated
        but the language cannot be identified. </p>
      <h4>4.1.3 Scripts and dialects</h4>
      <p>A single language code is normally provided for a language even though
        the language is written in more than one script. A separate standard
        may be developed for the purpose of designating information concerning
        the script or writing system of a language. </p>
      <p> The dialect of a language is usually represented by the same language
        code as that used for the language. If the language is assigned to a
        collective language code, the dialect is assigned to the same collective
        language code. If the language has an individual language code, the dialect
        is also included in that code rather than the code for the group to which
        both belong. In a few instances, however, both the language and a dialect
        of that language have their own individual language codes. </p>
      <h4>4.1.4 Local Codes</h4>
      <p>Codes qaa through qtz are reserved for local use, including for local
        treatment of dialects. These codes may only be used locally, and may
        not be exchanged internationally. </p>
      <h4>4.1.5 Ancient languages</h4>
      <p>Ancient languages that are not given individual language codes are assigned
        the code for the major language collective to which each belongs, rather
        than the code for the modern language which evolved from the ancient
        language. For example, <em>Old Frisian</em> is assigned the language
        code <em>gem</em> for the language group <em>Germanic (Other)</em> instead
        of the language code <em>fry</em> for the modern language <em>Frisian</em>. </p>
      <p> In cases of doubt, assistance may be sought from the Registration Authority. </p>
      <h4>4.2 Registration of new language codes</h4>
      <p>The Registration Authority for this part of ISO 639 shall be the Library
        of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540-4102 USA (c/o Network Development
        and MARC Standards Office)<a href="#footnote1">*1</a>. The Registration
        Authority for ISO 639-1 is Infoterm, Simmeringer Hauptstrasse 24, A-1110
        Vienna, Austria. </p>
      <h4>4.3 Application of language codes</h4>
      <p>Language codes can be used in the following specific instances. Examples
        of how language codes may be used follow each. </p>
      <h4>4.3.1</h4>
      <p>To indicate the languages in which documents are or have been written
        or recorded. </p>
      <p class="small">EXAMPLE<br>
        UNIMARC Format <a href="#footnote2">*2</a>, Field 101 Language of the
        item<br>
        A pamphlet is issued in Danish (language code <em>dan</em> used for <em>Danish</em>)<br>
        Field 101: 0#$adan </p>
      <h4>4.3.2</h4>
      <p>To indicate the languages in which document-handling records (order
        records, bibliographic records, and the like) have been created. </p>
      <p class="small">EXAMPLE<br>
        UNIMARC Format <a href="#footnote2">*2</a>, Field 100 Language of cataloguing; <br>
        positions <br>
        22-24<br>
        A book is written in <em>Dutch</em>, but the catalog record is in English <br>
        (language code <em>eng</em> used for <em>English</em>)<br>
        Field 100 positions 22-24: eng</p>
      <h4>4.3.3</h4>
      <p>To indicate the language-speaking capabilities of delegates to a meeting.
        (Alternatively, another international standard list may be used, for
        example ISO 639-1. </p>
      <p class="small">EXAMPLE - In a list of delegates issued at an ISO meeting,
        the codes <em>eng</em>, <em>fre</em> and <em>rus</em> indicate whether
        the delegates spoke in (eng) English, (fre) French, or (rus) Russian.</p>
      <h4>4.3.4</h4>
      <p>To indicate the original language of a document. </p>
      <p class="small">EXAMPLE - Document of the United Nations: <br>
        ST/DCS/1/Rev. 2 eng fre<br>
        [Document is bilingual.] </p>
      <h4>4.4 Application of the country code</h4>
      <p>Country codes from ISO 3166 may be combined with language codes to denote
        the area in which a term, phrase, or language is used. </p>
      <p> EXAMPLES</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="small">a spool of thread (eng US) </li>
        <li class="small">a bobbin of cotton (eng GB) </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5 Structure of the list of language codes</h3>
      <p>The list of language codes is presented in three tables: </p>
