            <p><b>ISO 639 </b>provides <b>two</b> sets of language codes, one 
              as a two-character code set <b>(639-1)</b> and another as a three-character 
              code set <b>(639-2)</b> for the representation of names of languages.            </p>
            <p><b>ISO 639-1</b>, <i>Codes for the representation of names of languages--Part 
              1: Alpha-2 code</i>, was devised primarily for use in terminology, 
              and includes identifiers for major languages of the world for which 
              specialized terminologies have been developed. The maintenance agency for ISO 639-1 is the <a href="http://www.infoterm.info/">International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm)</a>. </p>
            <p><b>ISO 639-2</b>, <i>Codes for the representation of names of languages--Part 
              2: Alpha-3 code,</i> was devised primarily for use in bibliographic 
              documentation and terminology. It includes identifiers for all of 
              the languages represented in part 1, as well as for many other languages 
              that have significant bodies of literature. It also provides identifiers 
              for groups of languages, such as language families, that together 
              indirectly cover most or all languages of the world. The maintenance agency for ISO 639-2 is the <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/standards/iso639-2/">Library of Congress</a>. </p>
            <p><strong>ISO 639-3</strong>, <em>Codes for the representation of names of languages - Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages</em>, is a code list that aims to define three-letter identifiers for all known  human languages. At the core of ISO 639-3 are the individual languages  already accounted for in <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/standards/iso639-2/">ISO 639-2</a>.  The large number of living languages in the initial inventory of ISO  639-3 beyond those already included in ISO 639-2 was derived primarily  from <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/">Ethnologue</a> (15th edition). Additional extinct, ancient, historic, and constructed languages have been obtained from <a href="http://linguistlist.org/ancientlgs.html">Linguist List</a>. </p>

          code lists?</a> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p><b>ISO 639-1</b>, the two-character code, was devised primarily 
              for use in terminology and includes identifiers for most of the 
              major languages of the world that are not only most frequently represented 
              in the total body of the world's literature, but that are also among 
              the most developed languages of the world, having specialized vocabulary 
              and terminology. ISO 639-1 includes identifiers for a subset of 
              the languages covered by ISO 639-2.</p>
            <p><b>ISO 639-2</b>, the three-character code, was devised primarily 
              for use in bibliography, as well as in terminology. It has a less 
              restrictive scope than ISO 639-1, being devised to include identifiers 
              for languages that are most frequently represented in the total 
              body of the world's literature, regardless of whether specialized 
              terminologies exist in those languages or not. Because three characters 
              allow for a much larger set of distinct identifiers, an alpha-3 
              code can accommodate a much larger set of languages. Indeed, ISO 
              639-2 does include significantly more entries than ISO 639-1, yet 
              the scope is not so broad as to result in a separate identifier 
              for every individual language that has been documented. ISO 639-2 
              limits coverage of individual languages to those for which at least 
              modest bodies of literature have been developed. Other languages 
              are still accommodated, however, by means of identifiers for collections 
              of languages, such as language families.</p>
            <p>In summary, the basic difference between ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 
              has to do with scope: the scope of ISO 639-1 is more restrictive, 
              focusing on languages for which specialized terminologies have been 
              developed. In practical terms, ISO 639-2 covers a larger number 
              of individual languages (due to its less-restrictive scope). It 
              also includes identifiers for collections of languages.</p>
            <p>Both code lists are considered <b>open lists</b> (i.e., it is possible 
              for new entries to be added to the lists).

        <li><a name="3">What are the differences between the terminology and bibliographic 
          codes in the ISO 639-2 standard?</a> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>In the <b>ISO 639-2</b> standard, two code sets are provided in 
              which the language codes are the same except for 22 of the 450+ 
              languages that have alternative codes. One set is for <b>bibliographic</b> 
              applications, often referred to as <b>ISO 639-2/B</b>, and the other 
              for <b>terminology</b> applications, referred to as<b> ISO 639-2/T</b>. 
              The choice of the set used must be made clear by exchanging partners 
              prior to information interchange.</p>
            <p>These alternative codes in <b>ISO 639-2 </b>exist for historical 
              reasons. At the time that ISO 639-2 was developed, there already 
              was a well-known and widely used language code list that had been 
              used for over 30 years in bibliographic systems which was largely 
              adapted for the 3-character code set . At the same time there was 
              the 2-character code list (now called <b>ISO 639-1</b>, previously<b> 
              ISO 639</b>), which covered far fewer languages than those for bibliographic 
              applications. There was a desire by some participants for the 3-character 
              codes for languages that were already in the 2-character list to 
              generally share the same 2 characters. In 22 cases the existing 
              bibliographic code was very different than the 2-character code 
              (because it was based on a different form of the language name), 
              but the impact on existing bibliographic systems with millions of 
              records using those well-established codes would have been enormous 
              if a new 3-character code were adopted. Thus, these alternative 
              codes were used for those languages. The alternative codes should 
              be considered as synonyms; there is no overlap in codes between 
              the B and the T list.</p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p><b> ISO 639-1</b>: <i>Codes for the representation of names of 
              languages: alpha-2 codes</i> was developed by the ISO TC37/SC2 in 
              1988 for use in <b>terminology, lexicography and linguistics</b>.            </p>
            <p><b>ISO 639-2</b>: <i>Codes for the representation of names of languages: 
              alpha-3 codes</i> was developed by the ISO TC37/SC2-TC46/SC4 Joint 
              Working Group. Work on the standard was initiated in 1989 because 
              of the inadequacy of the ISO 639-1 two-character code list to represent 
              a sufficient number of languages for <b>bibliographic and terminology 
              needs</b>. The list was largely based on the <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/marc/languages/"><i>MARC 
              Code List for Languages</i></a>, which has been in wide use since 
              1968. </p>
            <p><strong>ISO 639-3:</strong> In 2002, ISO TC37/SC2 invited SIL International (www.sil.org) 
              to participate in the development of a new standard based on the language 
              identifiers in the Ethnologue that would be a superset of ISO 639-2 and 
              would provide identifiers for all known languages. In 2004 the proposed 
              new standard, ISO/DIS 639-3 was released, incorporating identifiers for 
              living languages from the Ethnologue 15th ed. (www.ethnologue.com) and 
              for historical, ancient and constructed languages from the languages 
              database of LinguistList (linguistlist.org), accounting for more than 
              7000 individual languages. In February 2007, ISO 639-3 was adopted. 
Elements other than collections listed in ISO 639-2 are a subset of 
those listed ISO 639-3; every non-collective element in ISO 639-2 is 
included in ISO 639-3. The denotation represented by alpha-3 identifiers<br>
included in both ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 is the same in each standard, 
and the denotation represented by alpha-2 identifiers in ISO 639-1 is the 
same as that represented by the corresponding alpha-3 identifiers in ISO 
639-2 and ISO 639-3.            </p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p>There are a wide variety of processes for which it is necessary to 
              identify the specific language beforehand. Language-based indexing and 
              searching are fairly obvious examples from the realm of bibliographic 
              applications, as is semantic interpretation. But there are a number of 
              others: spell-checking, sorting, syllabification and hyphenation, 
              morphological and syntactic parsing, fuzzy string searches and 
              comparisons, speech recognition, speech synthesis, semantic associations, 
            thesaurus lookups, and potentially many others. </p>
            <p>Using &quot;the&quot; name of a language as the means of language identification in 
              machine applications poses two distinct problems of ambiguity. Firstly, 
              different languages can have identical or very similar names. For 
              example, there are four languages called Lele: Lele [lle] of Papua New 
              Guinea (Austronesian); Lele [lel] of the Democratic Republic of Congo<br>
              (Niger-Congo, Bantoid); Lele [lln] of Chad (Afro-Asiatic); Lele [llc] of 
              Guinea (Niger-Congo, Mande). Conversely, the same language may be called 
              by multiple different names, for example, one name used by native 
              speakers, another used by speakers of the neighboring language, and yet 
              another used by the national government.</p>
            <p>The ISO 639-1 code set was devised for use in terminology, lexicography 
              and linguistics.</p>
            <p>The ISO 639-2 code set was devised for use by libraries, information 
              services, and publishers to indicate language in the exchange of 
              information, especially in computerized systems. The codes have 
              been widely used in the library community and may also be adopted 
              for any application requiring the expression of language in coded 
              form by terminologists and lexicographers.</p>
            <p>The ISO 639-3 code set was devised for broad use in a variety of applications where more specific language coding was necessary than the other two standards provided. </p>

It also   describes how to register values for use in language tags and the creation of user-defined extensions for private interchange.The language tag consists of a primary subtag and a series of subsequent subtags, each of which narrows or refines the range of languages identified by the overall tag. It enables the user to specify, in addition to the primary language, other characteristics such as script, country, or variant. It is considered an Internet Best                 Current Practices for the Internet Community and gives guidance                 for the use of ISO 639 codes.</p>
            <p>RFC 4646 specifies use of a 2-character code from ISO 639-1 when                 it exists; when a language does not have a 2-character code assigned                 the 3-character code is used. Although it states that the 3-character <strong>terminology </strong>code is used in these cases where no 2-character                 code exists, this situation will not occur, since the only alternative                 codes in ISO 639-2 are for languages that already have a 2-character                 code.</p>

          for the language?</a> 
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The language codes in ISO 639-2 were developed to serve as a device 
              to identify a language or group of languages. They were NOT intended 
              to serve as abbreviations or short forms for languages, but rather 
              as a code that serves as a device to identify a language name. Some 
              codes in the list consist of letters that are used in some form 
              of the language name. This has not been possible in all situations, 
              however, and often one would need to know the English form of the 
              language name to recognize a relationship. There are situations 
              where codes have been selected that diverge from the language name. 
              In using the language codes, systems generally display the language 
              name represented by the code and not the code itself to users. Therefore 
              it becomes irrelevant whether the code is &quot;123&quot;, &quot;xyz&quot;, 
              &quot;eng&quot; or whatever.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Number of documents.</b> The request for a new language identifier shall include evidence that              one agency             holds 50 different documents in the language or that five agencies            hold a total of             50 different documents among them in the language. Documents include            all             forms of material and are not limited to text. This is a necessary              requirement, but not sufficient in and of itself. In addition the              following requirements will be considered.</li>
            <li><strong>Size and variety of literature.<br>
                          </strong>The size and variety of the literature in the language,              be it written or oral, will be              considered and should be documented in the proposal.               The documentation may be in the form of reference to library holdings              or 
              bibliographies or more general statements quantifying the literature              and its           variation. </li>
            <li><strong>National or regional support<br>
            </strong>The proposal should preferably be explicitly supported by            a national or regional             language authority or standardizing body. If such support for some            reason is             unobtainable, a recommendation from another authority or language           organization will be taken into account. </li>
            <li><strong>Formal or official status<br>
              </strong>If the language in question has some sort of &ldquo;official&rdquo; status,            documentation of             this status will greatly support the proposal.             The assignment of formal status to languages is in no way consistently            practiced             throughout the world, and the lack of such status is not a negative            argument if           other requirements are met. </li>
            <li><strong>Formal education<br>
            </strong>If the language is used as a means of instruction in formal            education on any            level, documentation of this use will support the proposal. Teaching            of the             language is also relevant, in particular if the teaching is extensive.</li>
            <li><b>Collective codes. </b>If the criteria above are not met, the 
              language may be included in a collective language code. The words 
              &quot;languages&quot; or &quot;Other&quot; as part of a language 
              name indicates that a language code is a collective one. See also 
              under <a href="#17">question 17</a>.            </li>
            <li><strong>Scripts.</strong><br>
              A single language code is normally provided for a language even though              the language is written in more than one script. <a href="http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/">ISO 15924</a> <em>Codes               for the representation of names of scripts</em> provides coding for               scripts. </li>
            <li><strong>Dialects.</strong> <br>
              A dialect of a language is usually represented by the same language               code as that used for the language. If there are multiple names              for the same language each will be included with a single code. If              the language              is              assigned to a collective language code, the dialect is assigned to              the same              collective               language code. The difference between dialects and languages will              be             decided on a case-by-case basis. </li>
            <li><strong>Orthography.</strong><br>
              A language using more than one orthography is not given multiple language           codes.
                <p>With the adoption of <strong>ISO 639-3</strong>: <em>Codes for the representation of names of 
                languages - Part 3: Alpha-3 code for comprehensive coverage of languages</em>

                identify a specific language variety. More information about the criteria

            <p>ISO 639-1 does not use collective codes, but ISO 639-2 does. References 
              from separate language names to the collective code used for that 
              language are not included in the ISO 639-2 standard, but may be 
              found in the<a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/marc/languages/"> <i>MARC 
              Code List for Languages</i></a>. </p>
            <p>Some language identifiers in ISO 639-1 and 639-2 may be considered &quot;macrolanguages&quot;. These are designated as individual language identifiers that correspond in a  one-to-many manner with individual language identifiers in ISO 639-3. For instance, ISO 639-3 contains over 30  identifiers designated as individual language identifiers for distinct  varieties of Arabic, while ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 each contain only  one identifier for Arabic, "ar" and "ara" respectively, which are  designated as individual language identifiers in those  parts of ISO 639. Macrolanguages are distinguished from language collections in that the  individual languages that correspond to a macrolanguage must be very  closely related, and there must be some domain in which only a single  language identity is recognized.</p>

            <p>ISO 639-2  was intended for written languages primarily, and 
              since Chinese is the same in its written form for Cantonese and 
              Mandarin, no distinction was made in the code list. . Individual Chinese languages included under the macrolanguage Chinese (coded as &quot;zh&quot; in 639-1; &quot;zho&quot; in 639-2/T and &quot;chi&quot; in 639-2/B) are listed at: <a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=zho">http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=zho</a>.

Before the standardization of ISO 639-3 these could be coded by using the code for Chinese with the country code (i.e. zh-CN for Chinese as spoken in China and zh-TW for Chinese as spoken in Taiwan) or by using a subtag registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">IANA</a>), (e.g. zh-guoyu).  </p>
