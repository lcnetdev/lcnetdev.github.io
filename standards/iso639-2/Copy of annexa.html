      <p> 
      <p> 
      <p> 
      <p> 
      <h3>A.1 Registration Authority ISO 639-2/RA</h3>
      The Library of Congress (LC) has been designated the Registration Authority 
      for this part of ISO 639(ISO 639-2/RA). It is responsible for registering 
      alpha-3 language codes according to these procedures. 
      <p> 
      <h3>A.2 Responsibilities of the Registration Authority</h3>
      <h4>A.2.1 Application for the registration of new and for the change of 
        existing language codes.</h4>
      ISO 639-2/RA shall receive and review application for the registration of 
      new language codes and for the change of existing ones. It shall suggest 
      an assignment of a code when the relevant criteria are met according to 
      the rules given in A.3.3 and A.3.4, and inform the applicant of the result 
      of ISO 639-2/RA actions. Such criteria shall include a request by one agency 
      with 50 documents in the language or a request by five agencies with a total 
      of 50 documents among them in the language. 
      <h4>A.2.2 Maintenance of list</h4>
      The ISO 639-2/RA shall maintain an accurate list of information associated 
      with registered language codes. If necessary, it shall safeguard any confidential 
      information. It shall process updates of registered language codes and distribute 
      them on a regular basis to subscribers and other parties. 
      <h4>A.2.3 Other general responsibilities</h4>
      ISO 639-2/RA shall do the following: 
      <ul>
        <li> Handle all aspects of the registration process in accordance with 
          good business practice. 
        <li>Indicate in operations that it has been designated as ISO 639-2/RA 
          by ISO. 
        <li>Provide an annual summary report on activity to the ISO/TC37 and ISO/TC46 
          Secretariats. 
        <li>Provide advice on implementation and use of this part of ISO 639, 
          as needed. 
      </ul>
      <h3>A.3 Joint Advisory Committee ISO 639/RA-JAC</h3>
      A Joint Advisory Committee ISO 639/RA-JAC is established to advise both 
      the ISO 639-1/RA Registration Authority and the ISO 639-2/RA Registration 
      Authority. It shall guide the application of the coding rules as laid down 
      in ISO 639-1 and this part of ISO 639, respectively. 
      <h4>A.3.1 Composition</h4>
      ISO 639/RA-JAC is composed of: 
      <ul>
        <li> One representative of the International Information Centre for Terminology 
          (Infoterm; representing ISO 639-1/RA) 
        <li>One representative of Library of Congress (LC; representing ISO 639-2/RA) 
        <li>Three representatives of ISO/TC37 (nominated by ISO/TC37) 
        <li>Three representatives of ISO/TC46 (nominated by ISO/TC46) 
      </ul>
      Both ISO/TCs may nominate substitute representatives. 
      <h4>A.3.1.1 Membership</h4>
      Both TCs may nominate substitute representatives. The representatives of 
      INFOTERM and the Library of Congress will hold the chair on a 2-year rotating 
      basis. Up to five technical experts may be asked to participate as non-voting 
      observers. The observers will be entitled to receive documents sent to the 
      RA-JAC membership and expected to provide comments in return. 
      <h4>A.3.2 Working procedures within ISO 639/RA-JAC</h4>
      ISO 639/RA-JAC will work primarily by correspondence and exceptionally by 
      meeting. If a meeting is necessary, it shall preferably be held in conjunction 
      with plenary meetings of ISO/TC 37 and ISO/TC 37/SC 2 or ISO/TC 46 and ISO/TC 
      46/SC 4. 
      <h4>A.3.3 Additions and deletions to the list of entities, changes of codes</h4>
      Requests for additions, deletions, and changes of codes shall be supported 
      by a justification. When ISO 639-2/RA consults ISO 639/RA-JAC about the 
      proposed inclusion, deletion or change, and suggests a code, ISO 639/RA-JAC 
      is obliged to respond within one month. Simultaneously ISO 639-1/RA will 
      be informed and asked for comments. 
      <h4>A.3.4 Reservation of codes</h4>
      When a request for inclusion of a new entity has been rejected, ISO 639-2/RA 
      may reserve the requested code for the use of the applicant and other possible 
      users. ISO 639-2/RA will keep a record of such reservations and will inform 
      the ISO 639-1/RA of such. 
      <h4>A.3.5 Creation of language codes</h4>
      The creation of language codes is subject to the rules described in ISO 
      639-1: <a href="#footnote">-*)</a>, 4.1 and 4.1 of this part of ISO 639. 
      <h4>A.3.6 Voting procedures</h4>
      Each member of ISO 639/RA-JAC has one vote (voting is obligatory). Voting 
      is conducted by writing (letter, telex, telefax) or in a meeting. Voting 
      by telephone must be confirmed by writing. Failure to reply is considered 
      as an abstention. 
      <p> A vote must be unanimous for it to pass. If an unanimous vote cannot 
        be reached, a second vote will be conducted. The letter ballot is to be 
        accompanied by all comments received. At least five positive votes are 
        required to pass. 
      <p> It is necessary for any amendments to this part of ISO 639 to be approved 
        following the voting rules before revisions are published.
