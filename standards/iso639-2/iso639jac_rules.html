        <h2><b>Rules of procedure for conducting business</b></h2>
        <p> 
        <h2><b>Draft for discussion </b></h2>
        (13 Jan. 2000) 
      </center>
      <p> 
      <hr>
      The following documents rules of procedure for the conduct of meetings and 
      email business by the ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee. It repeats some 
      information that is in ISO 639-2:1998 in the normative Annex A and elaborates 
      where necessary for clarification of procedures. In particular it details 
      how business is run in the absence of regular meetings. <b>Note that this 
      is currently a draft for discussion by the ISO 639/JAC.</b> 
      <p> 
      <hr>
      <p> 
      <h3><b>1. Composition of the Joint Advisory Committee</b></h3>
      <p> ISO 639/JAC is composed of: 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>one representative of the International Information Centre for Terminology 
          (Infoterm; representing ISO 639-1/RA) 
        <li>one representative of the Library of Congress (LC; representing ISO 
          639-2/RA) 
        <li>three representatives of ISO/TC 37 (nominated by ISO/TC 37) 
        <li>three representatives of ISO/TC 46 (nominated by ISO/TC46) 
      </ul>
      <p> Both ISO/TCs may nominate substitute representatives for a meeting. 
      <p> 
      <h3><b>2. Membership of ISO 639/JAC</b></h3>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Representatives of Infoterm and Library of Congress will hold the 
          chair on a 2-year rotating basis. The first term begins at the first 
          meeting in February 2000. 
        <li>Up to five technical experts may be asked to participate as non-voting 
          observers at a meeting. These experts are appointed by the ISO 639 TCs 
          responsible (TC37 and TC46) based on the issues and topics to be discussed. 
          If each TC wishes to appoint three observers, then a total of six may 
          be appointed. <b>This needs to be approved by the JAC to amend Annex 
          A.</b> 
      </ul>
      <p> 
      <h3><b>3. Procedures for conducting business at meetings</b></h3>
      <p><i>3.1. Agenda.</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>An agenda will be distributed at least two months prior to the meeting. 
          It will be amended as needed when meeting is convened if there is agreement. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>3.2. Voting.</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Each member of ISO 639/JAC has one vote. 
        <li>Voting is obligatory. 
        <li>A vote must be unanimous for approval of an item. If there are abstentions, 
          it shall not be considered unanimous approval. 
        <li>If a unanimous vote cannot be reached on an item, a second vote will 
          be conducted following discussion. 
        <li>At least five positive votes are required to pass on the second ballot. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>3.3. Role of observers</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>The designated observers (5) may attend a JAC meeting. No TC may appoint 
          more than 3 observers (thus, a maximum of 6 is possible). 
        <li>Observers shall function as experts concerning specific language issues, 
          not for procedural issues. 
        <li>Observers will be asked to contribute as necessary. 
        <li>Observers may not vote. 
      </ul>
      <h3><b>4. Procedures for conducting business by electronic mail</b></h3>
      <i>4.1. Electronic communications</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>An electronic distribution list will include all ISO 639/JAC members 
        <li>The distribution list is limited to the voting members of the committee. 
        <li>Documentation is distributed by the chair. It may be distributed to 
          JAC members only or to JAC members and observers depending upon the 
          topic. 
        <li>The more general list (iso639@dkuug.dk) may be used for discussion 
          about general or specific language issues. 
      </ul>
      <i>4.2. Electronic voting procedures</i> 
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Voting may take place on the list initially and confirmed in writing 
          (letter or telefax). <b>To be discussed: should we allow electronic 
          voting?</b> 
        <li>Votes must be submitted within two weeks of the electronic distribution 
          of the voting request. 
        <li>Failure to vote is considered an abstention (and thus a unanimous 
          ballot cannot be reached with an abstention). 
        <li>If a JAC member does not vote after two consecutive times, he/she 
          may be replaced by the appropriate TC. 
      </ul>
      <p><i>4.3. Role of observers</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>Observers will be included in electronic mail distributions when specific 
          language issues are discussed and their expertise is needed. 
        <li>Observers may be requested to perform research on specific language 
          issues when needed. 
      </ul>
      <p> <i>4.4. Deadlines for response</i> 
      <ul>
        <li>When a request for a new, deleted, or changed code is submitted to 
          the appropriate Registration Authority (Infoterm for 639-1 and Library 
          of Congress for 639-2), ISO 639/JAC is consulted. 
        <li>ISO 639/JAC is obliged to respond within one month after adequate 
          documentation, as determined by the chair, has been reached. 
      </ul>
