      <p> <b>TO:</b> Rebecca Guenther, Librarian, Network Development and MARC 
        Standards Office <br>
        <b>DATE:</b> February 14, 2000 
      <p> <b>VIA:</b> John Van Oudenaren, Chief, European Division 
      <p> <b>FROM:</b> Predrag Pajic, Reference Librarian 
      <p> <b>SUBJECT:</b> Bosnian language 
      <p> This paper examines the question of whether a separate Bosnian language 
        can be said to exist as the language (and hence, literature) of the Bosnian 
        people (South Slavic Muslims), for the purpose of creating a subject entry 
        and code for use in the catalogue of the Library of Congress. 
      <p> Proceeding from the premise that "The language of a people cannot be 
        the subject of negotiation," as the Croatian academician Radoslav Katicic 
        wrote in his article About the Croatian Literary Language (Jezik 35/1987, 
        2,pp. 33-38), we should attempt to understand the historical background 
        of those who live in Bosnia and the language they speak. 
      <p> The Slavs settled in Bosnia at the beginning of the 7th century, and 
        until 1463 lived sometimes semi-independently, and sometimes in independent 
        feudal states. In the beginning the territory of Bosnia comprised a very 
        small area around the upper reaches of the River Bosnia at the same time 
        Croats and Serbs were forming their own states. This small territory of 
        Bosnia was intermittently ruled by these Serbian or Croatian states up 
        to the 12th century, at which time it became a semi-independent vassal 
        of Hungary under the ban (warlord-governor), Boric (1154-63). Later, in 
        the 13th and 14th centuries, Bosnia expanded under the periodic governorship 
        of Croatian and Serbian landowners who annexed to it many parts of neighboring 
        feudal estates while remaining most of the time vassals of the Kingdom 
        of Hungary. Under its most prosperous ruler, the first king of Bosnia 
        Tvrtko I (1359-1391) who was crowned in the Serbian monastery of Milesevo 
        as the king of Serbs and Bosnians, Bosnia was established as a kingdom 
        and a separate south Slavic country with its own Bosnian church. This 
        church was founded on the basis of the Bogomil movement, a Protestant-like 
        sect that had separated from the Orthodox faith as early as the 10th century. 
      <p> In 1463 Bosnia was occupied by the Turkish Sultan Mehmed II (1432- 1481) 
        and became for the next four centuries part of the Ottoman Empire. About 
        the same time Duke (in Hungarian "herczeg") Stjepan Vukcevic Kosaca lost 
        his feudal lands that adjoined Bosnia, thus adding this dukedom "Herzegovina" 
        to it as part of the Turkish empire. During the Turkish occupation a considerable 
        number of the Serbian aristocracy and their servants who had been members 
        of the Bosnian church, converted to Islam, thus creating a new national 
        segment which later became the embryo of the Muslim nation or Bosnjaci. 
      <p> In the meantime the Croatian population which considered the Bosnian 
        church heretical remained within the Catholic faith, having the support 
        of adjacent Croatian Catholic principalities. 
      <p> In the 15th century groups of Sephardic Jews emigrated from Spain to 
        Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding their religion and ethnicity to the Catholics 
        (Croats), Muslims (later recognized as a nation), and Orthodox (Serbs). 
      <p> When the Ottoman Empire finally disintegrated in the 19th century Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina became an autonomous state within the Austro-Hungarian 
        monarchy in accord with the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. With the fall 
        of Austria-Hungary in 1918 Bosnia was integrated into the Kingdom of Serbs, 
        Croats, and Slovenes, which later changed its name to Yugoslavia. With 
        Yugoslavia's collapse in World War II and the division of its territory 
        among Hitler's allies, Bosnia and Herzegovina found itself part of the 
        newly created Independent State of Croatia. Four years later with the 
        capitulation of Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as one 
        of six federal states within a new Yugoslavia under Communist rule. After 
        the collapse of communism and on the basis of a 1991 referendum, Bosnia 
        and Herzegovina declared itself an independent state, which was subsequently 
        recognized internatonally on April 6, 1992. This triggered a civil war 
        which ended with the 1995 Dayton agreement and Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        was established with two entities: Federal Bosnia (consisting of Muslim 
        and Croatian territory) and Republika Srpska, the Serbian entity), both 
        under the political and military protection of the UN. 
      <p> The language spoken by the new settlers of Bosnia in the 7th century 
        was a Slavic language similar to all other Slavic languages. According 
        to Traian Stoianovich, professor emeritus of Rutgers University (NIN December 
        30, 1999 p. 65), it is not known to what degree the language of these 
        settlers was influenced by the languages of the tribes they found there, 
        but, in any case, with the coming of Christianity, Latin was introduced 
        in Bosnia. Nevertheless, literacy in the Slavic vernacular spread with 
        the missionary work of Saints Cyril and Methodius in the 10th century. 
        And during Bosnia's "golden age" in the 1300's the vernacular was the 
        language used in the courts, schools and in the Bosnian Church. In 1463 
        the Ottoman Turkish language became the official language of Bosnia. Slavs 
        who had converted to Islam and, thus, held local leadership positions 
        under the Sultan accepted the Ottoman Turkish language but also integrated 
        it into their own Slavic tongue. 
      <p> The language and literature of the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        subsequently developed in accordance with their ethnic roots. The famous 
        linguist of the 19th century, Vuk Karadzic, often called the father of 
        modern Serbo-Croatian, used the language of the people of Herzegovina 
        as the basis of his unified Serbo- Croatian language, one of the official 
        languages of former Yugoslavia before its collapse in 1991. 
      <p> With the establishment in 1991 of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
        the question of language became the subject of political, cultural, and 
        linguistic studies. However, the term "Bosnian language" is not a product 
        of the newly established state. The present-day Bosnian linguist, Alija 
        Isakovic, quotes many writers who favorably used the term from the Middle 
        Ages to the early 19th century, such as Evlija Celebi (1660, Turkish traveler 
        and historian), the Bosnian Franciscans M. Divkovic (1563-1631) and Andrija 
        Kacic-Miosic (1704-1760), and the writer and educator Dositej Obradovic 
        (1739-1811). The term "Bosnian language" was rarely used, however, during 
        the period up to 1918 when Bosnia was under the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
      <p> In the fall of 1999 the prominent Sarajevo weekly Dani, in cooperation 
        with USIS, organized a round-table conference with a number of members 
        of the Bosnian Academy of Science, university professors, cultural workers 
        from all segments of Bosnian society and of all nationalities. The participants 
        agreed that the question of the Bosnian language is as complicated as 
        their general political situation. But it was agreed that, since Croats 
        and Serbs call their languages by their national name, Slavic Muslims 
        (Bosnjak) should be able to do likewise. 
      <p> During the conference, Bosnian academician and philosopher, Muhamed 
        Filipovic, supported the thesis that all peoples of B&H speak ONE language 
        but their use of it may differ from one nationality to the other and such 
        differences should be encouraged. Considerable time was given to a discussion 
        of the first Bosnian official spelling book (Pravopis bosanskog jezika), 
        by Senahid Halilovic. The book was reviewed and approved by the Center 
        for Bosnian Studies within Preporod, the Cultural Society of Bosnians. 
        The author, in an extensive introductory text (155 pages) to the Pravopis, 
        lists spelling rules intended to single out those words that differ from 
        the words used by Croats or Serbs. He uses the same rules of grammar prevailing 
        for Croatian or Serbian, but in the dictionary section he adds more Turkish 
        words and inserts the letter "h" into Croatian or Serbian words. For example, 
        the English word "coffee" in Croatian is "kava," in Serbian, "kafa," and 
        Bosnian is listed as "kahva". The intention appears to be to list as many 
        words as possible, regardless of whether they are in popular usage or 
        not. In the first two pages of the Pravopis, 75 of the 130 words listed 
        are of Turkish origin, 30 are of Croatian or Serbian origin, and the remaining 
        25 are of foreign origin for which there are words in Serbian or Croatian. 
      <p> For all practical purposes, I believe we should make an attempt to recognize 
        the existence of the "Bosnian language," a term used in past centuries 
        and now an expression of identification of the Bosnian nation. This may 
        be rather difficult, since there is already a problem in differentiating 
        Serbian and Croatian as spoken in Bosnia. However, as noted above, the 
        presence of Turkish words, the insertion of the letter "h" in Serbian 
        or Croatian words, and, of course, the name (Christian or Muslim) of the 
        author, as well as place of publication (the federal part of B&H or Republika 
        Srpska) should be indicators of whether the publication is in the Bosnian 
        language.
