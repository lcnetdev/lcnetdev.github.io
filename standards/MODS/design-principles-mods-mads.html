      <h1>Design Principles for Enhancements to MODS and MADS </h1>
      <h2>(September 2009) </h2>
      <p>These statements are intended as guiding principles to be
        used in formulating future enhancements to the Metadata Object Description
        Schema (MODS) and the Metadata Authority Description Schema (MADS). The <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/editorial-committee.html">MODS Editorial Committee</a> developed these as principles to apply to any requested changes or additions.
        Approved changes for future versions are available on the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/mods">MODS website</a>. </p>
      <h3><strong>General statements about MODS and MADS and
          their relationship</strong></h3>
      <p><em>General description of MODS</em></p>
      <p>MODS is an XML schema and guidelines for encoding a resource
        description. It supports discovery and management of resources, and access
        to them, as well as exchange and management of encoded descriptions.</p>
      <p><em>General description of MADS</em></p>
      <p>MADS is an XML schema and guidelines for encoding an authority
        description. It supports control, normalization, and management of some
        types of data used in a resource description, as well as exchange and
        management of encoded descriptions.</p>
      <p><em>Relationship of MODS and MADS</em></p>
      <p>MODS and MADS can be used independently. To support those
        who implement them in an integrated manner, the definitions of elements
        and attributes in MODS and MADS are coordinated whenever appropriate,
        and there is an ability to reference a MADS record from a MODS record.</p>
      <h3><strong>Goals to guide the enhancement of MODS and
          MADS</strong></h3>

              schemas</p>
            <p>2) Provide unrestricted value options for attributes
              (such as "displayLabel") and elements that are likely to have local or customization needs</p>
            <p>3) Provide an option to include elements from
              other schemas where appropriate (such as for the "accessCondition" element, which may include elements from other schemas that focus on access)</p>

            <p>2) Define options for coded or natural language
              information</p>
            <p>3) Define options that allow for more or less
              granularity in a description (to support descriptive practices

              defined in MADS 1.0]</p>

              express meta-information below the element level</p>
            <p>2) Define a new element or attribute only when
              a need (retrieval, presentation, linking, communication ...) is
              expressed by a significant number of  MODS and MADS users</p>
            <p>3) Reuse an element or attribute when it is needed
              in more than one context, but has the same semantics (such as the
              reuse of &quot;name&quot; and &quot;title&quot; elements as children of the &quot;subject&quot; element)<br>
