<ol>
  <li> <b>Physical Form Designator </b> 
    <p>Version 1.2 has in Table 1 (bibliographic level) an element physicalFormDesignator 
      under BibPart, mandatory at levels B-2, B-3, B-4. These correspond to MARC 
      field 007/00-01. In the appendix (abstract record structure), it notes &quot;ESN 
      B-4&quot;. It says international string, although gives a list of values, 
      presumably from the NISO Z39.71 holdings standard.<br>
      Version 1.2 has in Table 2 (copy level) an element physicalFormDesignator 
      under BibPart (under BibPartAndParent), mandatory at level C-4.</p>
    <p>Version 1.3 has made changes to this element. It appears that it was removed 
      from Table 1 under BibPart. Instead there is an element piecePhysicalFormDesignator 
      under Piece, mandatory at level B-4 and specifying an instance of a the 
      physicalFormCode. There is also copyPhysicalFormDesignator, optional at 
      level C-4, specifying an instance of physicalFormCode.<br>
      <br>
      Version 1.3 has in Table 2 copyPhysicalFormDesignator under CopyLocation, 
      mandatory at levels C-2, C-3, C-4, specifying an instance of the physicalFormCode 
      as well as piecePhysicalFormDesignator under Piece (specifying the same). 
      There is also physicalFormDesignator under BibPart in Table 2, although 
      it is not clear whether this might be an error, since it does not appear 
      in the Appendix. The Appendix lists copyPhysicalFormDesignator and piecePhysicalFormDesignator, 
      although not in red as are the other elements that are added to this version. 
      They both specify physicalFormCode, which has the controlled list of values.</p>
    <p>I also note that in the XML schema for B-2, physicalFormDesignator is an 
      attribute, not an element.</p>
    <p>Questions about these elements: 
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p> Why were these changes made in version 1.3? 
      <li> 
        <p>Does the note &quot;B-4&quot; in the Appendix imply that it can only 
          be used at that level? 
      <li> 
        <p>Is only the code allowed? Can't a textual instance be used? This certainly 
          could occur (and is desirable for our proposed application; MARC itself 
          has a field in the holdings format which is a textual physical form 
          designator). 
      <li>The list of codes I assume came from NISO Z39.71, but it is incomplete 
        and only has some of those listed. Why?
      <li> Is physicalFormDesignator underBibPart in Table 2 an error? 
      <li> 
        <p>Is there any intention of changing the XML schema for B-2 to make it 
          an element? 
    </ul>
    <br>
  <li> <b>Summary Enumeration and Chronology</b> 
    <p>Version 1.2 has in Table 1 (bibliographic level) an element &quot;unstructured&quot;, 
      childEnumChronSummary, under BibPart that is optional at level B-2.<br>
      Version 1.2 has in Table 2 (copy level) &quot;unstructured&quot; under BibPart, 
      childEnumChronSummary, specifying one instance of the SummaryEnumSeq datatype.<br>
      Version 1.3 has in Table 1 and Table 2 childEnumChronSummary (structured 
      and unstructured) crossed out. Instead it has added &quot;unstructured&quot; 
      under SummaryEnum, optional at B-2 in Table 1 and optional at C-4 in Table 
      2.</p>
    <p>Questions about this element:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Why were these changes made in version 1.3 
      <li>Is unstructured under SummaryEnum allowable at level C-2? It doesn't 
        make sense for it to even be allowable at level C-4, but that's what the 
        table indicates.<br>
        <br>
    </ul>
  <li><b> Remote holdings data</b><br>
    This element is listed under Holdings Structure. It is defined in the Appendix 
    as &quot;Z39.50 URL for alternative/additional information about holdings 
    of this item at this location&quot;. I see that as pointing to holdings data 
    remotely. Is there anything that gives a remote holdings location, i.e. a 
    URL, as a location for a remotely held item. This would be used as an electronic 
    location as opposed to a physical location that goes under holdingsSiteLocation 
    and would correspond to MARC holdings field 856.<br>
