      <h1>MIX: Uses and Features</h1>
      <p class="box-desc">The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC 
        Standards Office, with interested experts, is developing a schema for 
        a bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety of purposes, 
        and particularly for library applications. As an XML schema it is intended 
        to be able to carry selected data from existing MARC 21 records as well 
        as to enable the creation of original resource description records. It 
        includes a subset of MARC fields and uses language-based tags rather than 
        numeric ones, in some cases regrouping elements from the MARC 21 bibliographic 
        format. This schema is currently in draft status and is being referred 
        to as the "Metadata for Images in XML Standard (MIX)". MIX is expressed 
        using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML schema language</a> 
        of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. The 
        standard is maintained by the <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/marc/ndmso.html"> 
        Network Development and MARC Standards Office</a> of the Library of Congress 
        with input from users.</p>
      <h2>1. Uses</h2>
      <p>MIX could potentially be used as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>as a <a href="http://www.loc.gov/z3950/agency/zing/zing.html">Z39.50 
          Next Generation</a> specified format</li>
        <li>as an extension schema to <a href="http://www.loc.gov/mets/">METS</a> 
          (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard)</li>
        <li>to represent metadata for harvesting </li>
        <li>for original resource description in XML syntax</li>
        <li>for representing a simplified MARC record in XML</li>
        <li>for metadata in XML that may be packaged with an electronic resource</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Advantages of MIX</h2>
      <p>MIX is intended to be a compliment to other metadata formats. For some 
        applications, particularly those that have used MARC records, there will 
        be advantages over other metadata schemes. Some advantages are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The element set is richer than Dublin Core</li>
        <li>The element set is more compatible with library data than ONIX</li>
        <li>The schema is more end user oriented than the full OAI MARC XML schema</li>
        <li>The element set is simpler than the full MARC format</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Features of MIX</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The elements generally inherit the semantics of MARC</li>
        <li>Some data has been repackaged; in some cases what is in several data 
          elements in MARC may be brought together into one in MIX</li>
        <li>MIX does not assume the use of any specific cataloging code</li>
        <li>Several elements have an optional ID attribute to facilitate linking 
          at the element level.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Limitations of MIX</h2>
      <p>MIX includes a subset of data from the <i><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/">MARC 
        21 Format for Bibliographic Data</a></i>. As an element set that allows 
        for the representation of data already in MARC-based systems, it is intended 
        to allow for the conversion of core fields while some specific data may 
        be dropped. As an element set for original resource description, it allows 
        for a simple record to be created in some cases using more general tags 
        than those available in the MARC record. </p>
      <p>However, the schema does not target round-tripability with MARC 21. In 
        other words, an original MARC 21 record converted to MIX may not convert 
        back to MARC 21 in its entirety without some loss of specificity in tagging 
        or loss of data. In some cases if reconverted into MARC 21, the data may 
        not be placed in exactly the same field that it started in because a MARC 
        field may have been mapped to a more general one in MIX. However the data 
        itself will not be lost, only the detailed identification of the type 
        of element it represents. In other cases the element in MARC may not have 
        an equivalent element in MIX and then the specific data could be lost 
        when converting to MIX.</p>
      <p>MIX does not include business rules for populating the elements. The 
        fields listed under &quot;xsd:documentation&quot; are intended as comments, 
        to refer the user to where the semantics for the elements listed may be 
        found. These MARC 21 elements listed are not intended to provide a crosswalk 
        between MIX and MARC; additional instructions would need to be provided 
        for conversion details.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>5. Order of Elements</h2>
      <p>Note that the order of elements in the MIX schema does not assume display 
        order. A stylesheet would be used to control display order of MIX records.</p>
