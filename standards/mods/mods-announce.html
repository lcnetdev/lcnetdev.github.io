<h2 align="center">Announcement: Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) available 
  for trial use</h2>
 
<p>The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office, with 
  interested experts, has developed the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS), 
  which is a bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety of purposes, 
  particularly for library applications. Information about MODS and the schema 
  (version 1.2) is available at: <a href="http://lcnetdev.github.io/mods"></a>.</p>
   
<p>As an XML schema it is intended to be able to carry selected data from existing 
  MARC 21 records as well as to enable the creation of original resource description 
  records. It includes a subset of MARC fields and uses language-based tags rather 
  than numeric ones, in some cases regrouping elements from the MARC 21 bibliographic 
  format. The elements inherit MARC semantics, so are more compatible with existing 
  library data than other metadata schemes.</p>
  
<p>MODS could potentially be used as follows:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>as a Z39.50 Next Generation specified format</li>
  <li>as an extension schema to METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard)</li>
  <li>to represent metadata for harvesting</li>
  <li>for original resource description in XML syntax (using MARC semantics)</li>
  <li>for representing a simplified MARC record in XML</li>
  <li>for metadata in XML that may be packaged with an electronic resource</li>
</ul>
 
<p>MODS includes a subset of data from the MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data. 
  As an element set that allows for the representation of data already in MARC-based 
  systems, it is intended to allow for the conversion of core fields from a MARC 
  21 record, while some specific data may be dropped. As an element set for original 
  resource description, it allows for a simple record to be created, in some cases 
  using more general tags than those available in the MARC record. The Library 
  of Congress has developed transformations to move MARC 21 records from 2709 
  form to MARCXML to MODS, with the software available from the MARCXML Web site.</p>
   
<p>There has been wide review and input to the development of the schema, which 
  is now available for trial use. It will remain stable for the next six months, 
  during which we invite comments as a result of experimentation.</p>
