    <td><p>Processing or cataloging non-traditional materials, such as Web sites,
        by way of traditional means has already proven to be inefficient. Traditional
        cataloging tools such as Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition
        (AACR2) and the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">Machine-Readable Cataloging
        (MARC)</a> metadata scheme for description have undergone several changes
        since libraries realized the need to catalog these volatile resources.
        In an earlier aspect of this project we selected, cataloged, and archived
        individual Web sites, one-by-one. We are now collecting Web sites by
        theme (e.g., Election 2000, September 11th, Election 2002) in bulk to
        archive. As we collect thematic sites, we create collection level AACR2/MARC
        catalog records for each theme in order to represent these items in our
        Integrated Library System (ILS). For each theme we have collected thousands
        of sites. Building upon traditional methods, we supplement the collection
        level metadata by  creating  title-level descriptive
        metadata for each Web site within the collection using the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">Metadata
        Object Description Schema </a>(MODS).</p>
      <p>The Network Development and MARC Standards Office (NDSMO) at the
        Library collaborated with metadata experts to develop  <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS
        (Metadata Object Description Schema)</a> in 2002-2003. MODS is an XML
        schema for a bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety
        of purposes. It is intended to be able to carry selected data from existing
        MARC 21 records as well as to enable the creation of original resource
        description records. It includes a subset of MARC fields and uses language-based
        tags rather than numeric ones, in some cases regrouping elements from
        the MARC 21 bibliographic format. MODS is now used widely for rich bibliographic
        metadata in digital library projects world-wide. Further information,
        including the schema itself can be found at the MODS Web site: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods</a></p>
      <p>The Minerva project's metadata component was an early testbed for MODS.
        Since the Library creates collection level records in the Integrated
        Library System (ILS), MODS is more compatible with existing MARC bibliographic
        collection level records. If it is decided to include MODS records in
        the ILS at a later date, that could be enhanced and incorporated into
      that system. </p>
      <p> MODS offers much flexibility in terms of how specific the markup
          can be (e.g. the cataloger can parse the data into subelements of a
        subject heading or just use an LCSH string).</p>
      <p> MODS has been endorsed as an extension schema for METS (Metadata
          Encoding and Transmission Standard), which is an encoding format for
          descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata for textual and
          image-based works. This  Digital Library Federation initiative
          is maintained at LC's  Network Development and MARC Standards
          Office (NDMSO). METS  packages together the different forms
          of metadata which are essential in a digital repository. This means
          that the MODS record could provide the descriptive metadata which then
          gets packaged with the administrative and structural metadata in a
          future repository. (More information on METS is at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets">http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets</a>) </p>
