    <td><h1>MODS  Version 3.1 changes</h1>
      <p>A  new version of the MODS XML schema (version 3.1)  now available
        at the MODS web site at:
        <a href="v3/mods-3-0.xsd">www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-1.xsd</a>.      </p>
      <p>This replaces version 3.0, which was finalized in January 2004. Changes
        are minor in that there are additions and corrections that do not invalidate
        existing MODS 3.0 instances. The primary need for revision is to incorporate        the
        changes necessary to finalize MADS version 1.0 so
        that MADS may reference MODS elements        instead
        of repeating them. There are several other changes that have been        discussed
        on the MODS list by implementors or are small additions that we would
        like to        incorporate
        at this time.  The new version of MODS makes
        the following changes.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Implement the reorganization for implementation of MADS, since it
          uses MODS<br>
          structures.          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Change &lt;coordinates&gt; to no longer be required under &lt;geographic&gt;.  
          This was an oversight/error.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Define &lt;part&gt; under &lt;mods&gt;, not just &lt;relatedItem&gt;.
          Take out          documentation (in MODS guidelines) restricting &lt;relatedItem&gt; to          type=&quot;host&quot;.<br>
        <li>Addition of attribute &quot;objectPart&quot; to &lt;language&gt; to
          indicate language          of what part of the resource described (to
          be distinguished from the lang          and xml:lang attributes, which
          refer to language of the value in the tag).          e.g. &lt;language
          objectPart=&quot;summary&quot; authority=&quot;iso639-2b&quot;&gt;spa&lt;/language&gt;          indicates
          that only the summary is in Spanish.          Rationale: there is no
          way to indicate that the language specified is for          something
          other than the entire text.
(Note: MARC 21 uses separate subfields in field 041 for these distinctions.)
<p></p>
</li>
        <li>Add attribute &quot;type&quot; to dateOther to specify other kinds
          of dates. (Not          enumerated list).<br>
          Rationale: Everyone has their favorite date type associated with specific
          materials. MODS enumerates the most important ones as specified by
          users,          but  because of the importance and variety of dates
          associated with objects, it is desirable to allow for extensibility
          for other types of dates.          <br>
        </li>
        <li>        Changes for the emerging content standard Cataloging Cultural
          Objects<br>
          <ul>
            <li>add attribute &quot;type&quot; to &lt;genre&gt;<br>
              Rationale: to distinguish different aspects of genre: in CCO this
                  includes              class, work type, style.
            </li>
            <li>add attribute &quot;type&quot; to &lt;form&gt; under &lt;physicalDescription&gt;<br>
              Rationale: to be able to specify whether the form concerns materials
                or              techniques.e.g. type=&quot;material&quot;: oil paint; type=&quot;technique&quot;:
              painting
            <li>add attribute &quot;type&quot; to &lt;physicalLocation&gt; under &lt;location&gt;<br>
              Rationale: to indicate different kinds of locations, e.g. current,              discovery, former, creation              
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Allow for empty elements for xlinked elements.          Rationale:
        xlink is an attribute, so the element with which it's          associated may be empty if only a link and no text is needed.        <br>        
        <li>Add displayLabel attribute in &lt;classification&gt;.          Rationale:
          corresponds to MARC 050$3 (materials specified), which is needed          for
          instance for mapping to LC's American Memory records.<br>
        <li>The base of urlType changed to xsd:anyURI, from xsd:string. <br>
          Rationale: this enforces the URI syntax, instead of just using string.
             <br>        
        <li>extensionType, change<br>&lt;          xsd:any processContents=&quot;skip&quot; ....../&gt;<br>
to<br>
&lt;xsd:any processContents=&quot;lax&quot; ....../&gt;<br>
Rationale: changing to &quot;lax&quot; allows a user to define an extension and
have
it validate if he supplies a schema, and also allows it to avoid
validating by simply not defining a schema.

        annotations, comments, etc. that are not part of the schema itself. </p>
