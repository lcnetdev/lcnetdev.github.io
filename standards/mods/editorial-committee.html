      3)  Calls are held monthly, though may be canceled or moved if necessary and agreed to by the committee.<br>
            <br>
      4)  A member of the MODS/MADS EC is expected to attend at minimum two thirds of the calls.</p>

              <li> During any (rolling) six-month period, if a member is not present for at least two   thirds of the calls, the member&rsquo;s membership will be placed &ldquo;in   jeopardy&rdquo; and the member will be asked either to confirm that he/she   wishes to remain a member, or to resign.   </li>
