        <h2><a name="xquery"></a>XQuery: Its Relationship to CQL</h2>
        <p>Query languages for the most part are either: <br>
          (a) powerful and expressive but complex and cryptic, not human-friendly;
            or <br>
          (b) simple and easy to understand, user-friendly, but lacking in functionality. </p>
        <p>Examples of (a) are W3C's XQuery, SQL, and the Z39.50 type-1 query.
          Examples of (b) are CCL and Google. Query languages in general do not
          combine functionality and user-friendliness; CQL is an attempt to combine
          these two features. </p>
        <p>More to the point, CQL's goal is to combine the simplicity and intuitiveness
          of google searching with the expressive power of the Z39.50 query;
          to allow users to begin with very simple queries and work their way
          up to arbitrarily complex expressions as necessary.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;For example, the following (valid) CQL queries are intuitive
          and need no explanation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> birds </li>
          <li> birds or dinosaurs</li>
          <li> dinosaur not reptile</li>
          <li> dinosaur and bird or dinobird</li>
          <li> title= dinosaur and author=crichton</li>
          <li> (((a and b) or (c not d) not (e or f and g)) and h not i) or j</li>
          <li> publicationYear &lt; 1980</li>
          <li> numberOfWheels &lt;= 3</li>
          <li> numberOfToes &lt;&gt; 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the following are reasonably but not completely intuitive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> birds prox dinosaurs&nbsp; --&nbsp; &quot;find birds near dinosaurs&quot;</li>
          <li> birds proxprox/distance=1/unit=sentence dinosaurs&nbsp; -- &quot;...
            . Within the same sentence&quot;</li>
          <li> dc.title= dinosaur and bath.author=crichton&nbsp; -- &quot;find
            dinosaur in the dc title index and crichton in the bath author index&quot;</li>
          <li> author all &quot;crichton michael&quot;&nbsp; -- &quot;author
            contains all of these words&quot;</li>
          <li> author any &quot;crichton michael&quot;&nbsp; -- &quot;author
            contains any of these words&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second set of examples reflect more functionality that those in
          the first set and are correspondingly more complex, but not disproportionately
          so.</p>
        <p>XQuery, on the other hand, is a large and complex specification, which
          has been in development for a long time (several years) and consists
          of a number of (12 or so) large documents.&nbsp; It is difficult to
          comprehend without committing several days to reading the documents.
          CQL, by contrast, can be understood completely in an hour or so. </p>
        <p>The XQuery development has been influenced, almost entirely, by two
          very distinct constituencies: (1) XML-as-document and (2) XML-as-data.&nbsp; The
          first reflects XML's roots as SGML, while the second reflects a relational
          database bias.&nbsp; Neither of these constituencies &quot;won&quot;;
          XQuery, rather than defining different queries for the different models,
          attempts to meet the needs of both constituencies with a single language. </p>
        <p>Both XQuery and CQL assume that information is returned as XML. But
          XQuery goes a step further. It assumes that the information <i>to be
          queried</i> is (or is representable as) XML; CQL makes no such assumption.&nbsp;</p>
        <p> Both languages specify a non-xml syntax; XQuery, in addition, defines
          an alternative XML syntax.* In the XQuery case, this reflects apparent
          inability to resolve the question of whether an XML query syntax should
          itself be XML. Though on the surface it seems a good idea, the CQL
          developers ultimately decided it was not. </p>
        <blockquote class="box1"> *(CQL did specify an alternative XML sytax,
          XCQL, in version 1.0, but abandoned it in 1.1. That is, it abandoned
          it for purposes of <i>submitting </i>the query. CQL retains the XCQL
          spec to be used by server to &quot;echo&quot; the query that was submitted.)</blockquote>
        <p>An example of a&nbsp; simple (non-xml) XQuery query is:</p>
        <pre class="box2">let $title := /book/title<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; return 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;returnedTitle&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $title
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/returnedTitle&gt;</pre>
        <p>which is reasonably intuitive, it says &quot;find all elements &lt;title&gt; within
          element &lt;book&gt; and return these as XML fragments each wrapped
          in an element &lt;returnedTitle&gt;&quot;.</p>
        <p>This example illustrates some fundamental differences from CQL:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> With XQuery, you don't get a result set maintained at the server,
            rather, you get all the results back in the query response. This
            is because, unlike Z39.50 (and SRU) there isn't a presumption of
            a protocol. (Actually, it seems, there is a presumption of <em>no</em> protocol.)&nbsp; CQL
            doesn't address how results are to be returned, rather, it assumes
            that there is a protocol which governs its use, for example (but
            not necessarily), SRU. </li>
          <li> With XQuery, you search according to a search schema, for example,
            there is a presumption in the above example that there are &lt;title&gt; elements
            with &lt;book&gt; elements.&nbsp; Z39.50 (and SRU) use abstract access
            points instead, for example when you search on 'title' the server
            interprets '&quot;title' however it chooses. </li>
          <li>There really is no concept of record in the XQuery data model.
            In the above example you may get a bunch of titles returned, but
            they may all be from the same document. You would get a hit count,
            but it wouldn't be the number of records. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>XQuery could be very useful and appropriate for searching, for example,
          the congressional record, assuming that it is exposed in XML, where
          the specific schema of the data is well-known. It would also be useful
          for relational databases.&nbsp; It would not be useful for bibliographic
          data, record-based databases, or for metasearching across diverse databases;
          instead, CQL/SRU, will be more appropriate. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2> <a name="openurl"></a>OpenURL and SRU</h2>
        <p>SRU is sometimes compared with OpenURL. People ask &quot;why isn't
          OpenURL used for searching, rather than SRU?&quot;</p>
        <p>OpenURL packages metadata, about a desired resource, along with additional
          context information, into a URL. SRU packages query parameters, which
          similarly are often metadata about a desired resource, along with protocol
          information, into a URL. So there are similarities between OpenURL
          and SRU.</p>
        <p>But the comparison is superficial. It's useful to look more closely
          at the OpenURL model. OpenURL links a user to an appropriate resource.
          It does this in part by including bibliographic information about the
          resource. As that information might lead to several resources, context
          information is also included in the URL, to help select the most appropriate
          from among those several resources. </p>
        <p>In a typical OpenURL scenario&nbsp; a user (<em>requester</em>) accesses
          a server (<em>referrer</em>) on which there is an article (<em>referring
          entity</em>) which cites a reference (<em>referent</em>). The reference
          looks like it might be a normal link that the user can click, but it's
          really an OpenURL -- an&nbsp; HTTP URL, not a URL for a specific resource,
          but instead, metadata about these <em>context entities</em> (requester,
          referrer, refering entity, referent). And the base url (i.e. where
          the url is being sent) isn't the location of the desired resource,
          instead it is what's known as a <em>resolver</em> -- a server designed
          to take all this information and determine what resource the user really
          wants (or is &quot;most appropriate&quot;).&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote> Note: There may be an additional step: when the user clicks
          on the link it might first get a menu of services:&nbsp; full text,
          abstract, table of contents, reviews, etc.&nbsp; The user selects one
          and this desired&nbsp; <em>service type</em> is also included in the
          URL.</blockquote>
        <p>So SRU and OpenURL serve very different purposes. One selects records
          based on search criteria, the other selects a single resource, the
          one deemed&nbsp; &quot;most appropriate&quot;, from among a number
          of potential resources, based on context information. </p>
        <p>Note also that&nbsp; OpenURL intends to locate a single resource,
          while SRU finds all resources that meet specified criteria.&nbsp; OpenURL
          generally returns full text of the resource (or if not full text of
          the resource, text for some desired service). With SRU, the request
          can specify the format of the response records, and the response might
          not include any record, but instead indicate a result count (and the
          user may subsequently retrieve records from the result set). </p>
        <p>Thus SRU is an information retrieval protocol. OpenURL is not. On
          the other hand, OpenURL, clearly, addresses functions that SRU doesn't
          contemplate.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2> <a name="oai"></a>OAI, SRU, and OpenURL: How might these three work
          together?</h2>
        <p>These three can work together in a complimentary manner. First consider
          the complimentary roles of OIA and SRU.</p>
        <p>In the OAI model, a service provider accesses a metadata repository
          via the OAI protocol, to harvest records from the repository. There
          is little selectivity available to the service provider, it simply
          takes the metadata records available, subject to some basic filtering,
          for example time of creation or sub-repository name. The result is
          a somewhat random collection of metadata records. The OAI protocol
          does not address how that database might be searched. That's where
          SRU would come in. The service provider would interface an SRU server
          to the database of metadata records for an SRU client to access. </p>
        <img src="../background/images/oai.gif" alt="Graphic representation of OAI model" hspace="11" border="0" align="left">
        <p> In this model, where an SRU server has access to harvested metadata,
          an OpenURL provider can effectively utilize an SRU client who has access
          to this server.</p>
        <p>In the OpenURL model as described <a href="#openurl">above</a> a user
          accesses an article which cites a reference, which looks like a normal
          link that the user can click, but it's really an OpenURL, filled with
          metadata.&nbsp; The system that provides the OpenURL needs access to
          metadata in order to populate the OpenURL with metadata and also to
          keep the metadata up-to-date. For example, the system might want to
          create an OpenURL for a resource for which it has an identifier, or
          a title; it would search the respository on that identifier or title,
          thereby obtaining other metadata elements for the resource. </p>
        <hr>
        <h2><strong><a name="srupostget"></a>SRU: Post Vs. Get</strong></h2>
        <p>The question &quot;<i>why not POST an SRU request instead of (or as
            an alternative to) using GET?&quot; </i>was raised, because:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> SRU query URLs sometimes exceed the maximum length supported by
            some toolkits or servers. <br>
            <br>
            By using HTTP POST (rather than GET) to transmit the URL the substring
            following the base URL would be sent in the body of the HTTP message;
            this&nbsp; effectively avoids string-length limitations, since usually
            the base URL isn't terribly long.&nbsp; <br>
          </li>
          <li> Certain queries are difficult or impossible to send via GET because
            of character encoding complexities. There is no way to indicate character
            encoding with GET; with POST, you can explicitly state the character-set.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>SRW uses POST; currently SRU uses GET, and the suggestion is to also
          allow SRU via POST. Then we would effectively have three methods for
          how SRW/U is handled via HTTP: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> POST with SOAP (SRW)</li>
          <li>GET (SRU)</li>
          <li> POST without SOAP (SRUP - new POST option for SRU)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are two issues: </p>
        <h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>Currently&nbsp; SRW and SRU messages go to the same base URL where
          (some toolkits assume) that anything received via&nbsp; POST is SRW,
          so the message is passed to SOAP, while GET messages go to a different
          process for SRU processing.&nbsp; In other words the software distinguishes
          SRW from SRU solely based on HTTP method, POST or GET. By adding this
          third method, they wouldn't be able to get away with that any longer. </p>
        <p>One possible solution is to use different addresses for the different
          methods, and there are a number of suggestions for resolution, for
          example, Explain can provide a list of methods supported and corresponding
          addresses, or this could be done via &lt;links&gt; in &lt;databaseInfo&gt;.&nbsp; And
          it is also suggested that&nbsp; Explain could&nbsp; make this distinction
          without distinct addresses: You can already say SRW/U meaning that
          you support SRW and SRU at the same address.&nbsp; With an addition
          of a 'method' attribute you can say if you support SRU via POST or
          GET. (The value would be a space separated list. So you could have: &lt;...
          protocol=&quot;SRW/U&quot; method=&quot;POST GET&quot;&gt;.)</p>
        <h3>Complexity of Adding a Third Method</h3>
<p>The consensus appears to be that the cost of this complexity
          is worth the gain. Not allowing SRUP would mean that some queries will
          be impossible without SOAP, and the people affected are likely to just
          implement it anyway, allowed or not.</p>
<p>So, assuming we define a third method, SRUP, the SRU choices for an
          implementor (leaving aside SRW considerations for the moment) become:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>SRU alone</li>
          <li>SRU + SRUP&nbsp; </li>
          <li> SRUP alone</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, simple clients are most likely to continue to use SRU GET,
          so it is important that&nbsp; choice (3) be disallowed.&nbsp; The best
          way to do that is to explicitly declare that conformance to SRU requires
          that GET be implemented (whether POST is implemented or not).&nbsp; This
          argues in favor of formalizing SRUP, because otherwise there would
          be no context for such a conformance rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
        <hr>
        <h2><a name="opensearch" id="opensearch"></a>Opensearch Vs. SRU Parameter
          Names</h2>
        <p>One of the interesting features of openSearch is that the parameter
          names are not fixed. The parameters defined by the openSearch query
          spec are (1) the query, (2) number of records desired, (3) offset.&nbsp; There
          are analogous SRU parameters. In SRU these three parameters have well-defined
          names.&nbsp; However the openSearch spec does not define names for
          these parameters, rather it allows an openSearch server to use whatever
          names it wants. For example, consider these three queries:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>http://www.solent.tv/opensearch.aspx?q=chicago%20white%20soxr&amp;c=20&amp;s=1</li>
          <li> http://www.koders.com/?s=chicago%20white%20sox&amp;p=1&amp;output=rss</li>
          <li> http://www.unto.net/aws?searchTerms=chicago%20white%20sox&amp; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; searchIndex=SportingGoods&amp;style=desc&amp;format=osrss </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In (1) the query is supplied by the parameter with name 'q'. In (2)
          the query parameter is 's', and in (3), 'searchTerms'. Note also that
          there are additional parameters beyond the base three, for example
          'output' in (2) and 'format' in (3).</p>
        <p>This works, because openSearch requires that a server provide a so-called
          openSearchDescription, which is in a real sense analogous to ZeeRex,
          which &quot;explains&quot; all the parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The reasoning for this (as explained by the openSearch developer)
          is to allow a company to use an existing query format, that is, the
          same parameters, as long as the base three match up semantically.</p>
        <p> (And it is interesting to observe, this is working in the real world,
          based on the idea of self-configuring clients, the same concept as
          that of ZeeRex.)</p>
        <p>Here is a sample xml element, &lt;url&gt;, which is included in a
          description file and server to explain the openSearch parameters accepted:</p>
        <blockquote>&lt;Url&gt;http://search.athenscounty.lib.oh.us/cgi-bin/koha/opensearch?|<br>
            q={searchTerms}&amp;searchindex=NPLKoha&amp;startPage={startPage}<br>
            &amp; count={count}&amp;relevanceScale={relevanceScale}&lt;/Url&gt;</blockquote>
        <p>Thus &quot;q={searchTerms}&quot;&nbsp; serves to explain that the
          parameter name 'q' is to be used for the query, etc.&nbsp; Note also
          that this example defines a local parameter, 'relevanceScale'.&nbsp; Local
          parameters are not expected to necessarily be supported by the client. </p>

        <h2><a name="z3950"></a>SRU and Z39.50</h2>
        <p>The SRU Initiative recognizes the importance of Z39.50 (as currently
          defined and deployed) for business communication. While SRU focuses
          on getting information to the user, building on Z39.50 semantics enables
          the creation of gateways to existing Z39.50 systems.</p>
        <p> SRU combines several Z39.50 features, most notably, the Search, Present,
          Sort and Scan Services. Additional features/services may be added later
          or defined later as new web services.</p>

        <h3>Z39.50 Concepts Retained in SRU</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Result Sets </li>
          <li>Abstract Access points</li>
          <li>Abstract Record schemas</li>
          <li>Explain </li>
          <li>Diagnostics</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some SRU Differences from Z39.50 </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><i><strong>Result Set Named by Server</strong></i><br>
            In contrast to Z39.50 where the client names the result set, for
              SRU the server assigns the result set id. </li>
          <li><i><strong>Connections, Sessions, State</strong></i><br>
            There is no explicit concept of connection, session, or state. </li>
          <li><i><strong>No distinction between server and database</strong></i><br>
            SRU does not distinguish between a server and a database; it is hoped
              that elimination of the database concept will effect significant
              simplification (since the multiple-database concept in Z39.50 has
              caused such complexity), for example Explain is significantly simplified
              (and hopefully it will therefore become more widely implemented). </li>
          <li><strong><i>Single record syntax</i></strong><br>
            All SRU records are retrieved according to a single record syntax
              (XML) and therefore the (Z39.50) concept of record syntax is not
              necessary. The (Z39.50) concepts of element set/specification and
              schema are represented by XML schemas, e.g. Dublin Core, Onix,
              MODS, and MarcXml.</li>
          <li><i><strong>String Query</strong></i><br>
            SRW specifies string queries base on the query language, CQL. Z39.50,
              in contrast, does not define a human-readable query language. The
              CQL syntax includes the result set name, and supports both the
              capability to qualify a result set (e.g. "records in result set
              'A' where title is 'B' ") and to specify only a result set name
              (e.g. "records in result set 'A'") analogous to a Z39.50 Present. </li>
          <li><i><strong>Flat Indexes</strong></i><br>
            Flat indexes are defined, rather than utilizing attribute vectors
              as in traditional Z39.50. </li>
          <li><i><strong>Simplified Explain</strong></i><br>
            Explain information is not based on the Z39.50 Explain concept of
              searching an Explain database for specific information, but rather,
              all explain information for a server is contained in a single file,
              retrieved in a single operation. Explain information includes supported
              access points and record schemas. The Explain simplification also
              owes in large part to the SRW simplification discarding multiple
              databases and record syntaxes, and it is hoped that there will
              be more motivation to implement the SRW version of Explain (than
              there was to implement the Z39.50-1995 Explain) because of the
              substantial simplification. </li>
          <li><i><strong>XML instead of ASN.1.</strong></i><br>
            XML is used for abstract syntax as well as encoding. ASN.1/BER is
              not used. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong><a name="federated" id="federated"></a>Federated Search</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Eric Morgan </strong><br>
          asks: What are some techniques to implement federated search against
            a collection of SRU-accessible indexes?</p>
        <h3>Responses</h3>
<p><strong>Ralph LeVan<br>
          </strong>We created a federating database that forwards a search to
          multiple databases, accumulates the responses to build indexes for
          a new (single) virtual database, and provides search against this new
          database. It assumes similarity among the remote databases - does no
          query mapping or record syntax normalization but uses the explain record
          from the first database on its list as its own explain record. <strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        <strong>Rob Sanderson<br>
        </strong>Scan all known indexes on remote database and create a document
        that represents that server, with a field containing all terms in a given
        index.&nbsp; Index these documents. For a given request, search the proxy
        documents constructed to find databases that are likely to have a match.
        Rank them by relevance using the frequency of the term in the index (as
        retreived with scan). Then search the matching databases in order of
        relevance. If you're expecting to make this available over the web, then
        limiting the number of parallel searches at any one time is a good idea
        or you'll blow away either your own server or the remote database.</p>
        <p><strong>Matthew Dovey</strong><br>
          Let's say we search three databases <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong>.
          We send a searchRetrieve request to all three ( no records to be returned). <strong>A</strong> says
          it has 15 results, <strong>B</strong> says 10, and <strong>C</strong>,
          5. In our user interface we only display 10 records at a time, so we
          start by displaying the first 10 from <strong>A</strong> (a second
          searchRetrieve this time asking for 10 records). If the user selects
          the next page, we pull back the remaining 5 from <strong>A</strong>,
          and the first 5 from <strong>B</strong>, and so on.</p>
        <p>An optimization/improvement:</p>
        <p> <strong><em>the &quot;Centroid&quot; approach </em> </strong></p>
<p>Retrieve the list of terms from an index from each database via scan.</p>
        <p> For example, say:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Database <strong>A</strong> for authors returns the list:
            <ul>
                <li> Smith - 15 occurences</li>
              <li> Shakespeare &#8211; 10 occurences</li>
              <li> Morgan - 1 occurence</li>
              <li> Dovey - 10 occurences</li>
              <li> Sanderson &#8211; 15 occurences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Database <strong>B</strong> the list:
            <ul>
                <li> Smith - 28 occurences</li>
              <li> Morgan - 10 occurences</li>
              <li> Dovey -5 occurences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Database <strong>C</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li> Smith - 28 occurences</li>
              <li> Sanderson &#8211; 10 occurences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Searching for &quot;author=Morgan&quot;, there is no point in sending
          a request to database <strong>C</strong>, and probably not much point
          sending to <strong>A</strong> either. This approach reduces the number
          of database you need to search for a particular query. (However, it
          isn't very good if you are trying to locate particular items, for example
          if these were databases of rare<br>
          books.)</p>
