      <h1>Authentication Tokens</h1>

        <p> SRU does not define any method to distinguish among concurrent users,
          but some business models may impose requirements, for example, to ensure
          that one user does not modify another's resultsets, to allow a server
          to restrict a user to a pre-determined number of searches before charges
          are imposed, or to limit the number of concurrent searches for a user
          or number within a certain time frame. Or, on the other hand, if it
          can be demonstrated that a search has led directly to a sale, then
          the user may receive a commission. Another example is to enable the
          service to track how different users use the system, possibly to enforce
          acceptable usage policies.</p>
        <p>This document aims to discuss the various methods in which different
          users may be authenticated in an interoperable manner. In a stateless
          environment, or one where the ability to track individual users is
          not important, this can be ignored without peril. </p>
        <p>There are several technical methods by which distinct users may be
          identified, from IP address to additional header information to SSL.
          The different methods create additional requirements and function at
          various levels of success. </p>
        <p><b>IP Address</b><br>
          Users may be differentiated by the IP address from which they are connecting
            to the SRU server. Unfortunately this is unreliable at best due to
            the increasing use of web proxy systems -- there may be many users
            all of which appear to be coming from the same IP address due to
            a proxy. The advantage is that it is completely transparent to the
            client and hence the user, so for a small service may be appropriate. </p>
        <p><b>Basic Authentication</b><br>
          Basic Authentication is the fairly simple method used in many web servers
            to authenticate users against a list or database -- the client is
            required to send a username and password. This is a very easy-to-configure
            method to authenticate users, however it does not allow for users
            that are not authenticated -- every request must have a valid user
            and password sent or it will be rejected. This model is appropriate
            for a paid-for service or one which is used only by a set of known
            individuals, but is less appropriate for a service which may be used
            by anyone. </p>
        <p><b>Secure Sockets</b><br>
          SSL is an encrypted version of HTTP (https) and hence is more secure
            than basic authentication alone as the traffic cannot be easily intercepted.
            For financial transations using SRU then this is certainly appropriate
            as the user is already known in advance and every care for the data
            must be taken. However for every day services that may be used by
      anyone, it is a very complex solution.</p>
      <p><strong>Additional Message Data</strong><br>
        The preferred method for identifying users while still allowing non-authenticated
          access is by the inclusion of an additional field in the extraRequestData
            and extraResponseData fields. This method allows the server to
            chose when authentication is required (for example only if a resultset
            is needed) and when it can continue to act in a stateless fashion.
            This may be appropriate for any sort of transaction with the exception
            of cases when the data should be conveyed in an encrypted fashion,
            in which case SSL should be used as well. </p>
        <p>The recommended name for this field is <i>authenticationToken</i>,
          and hence <i>x-authenticationToken</i> when it is passed on the URL
          for SRU. If the server sends back one of these tokens with a response,
          then the client should return it in the same fashion in any subsequent
          request to allow the server to know that the requests should be considered
          to be from the same user. </p>
        <p> Further business logic may be required to manipulate these tokens.
          For example a separate SOAP service may be required to distribute the
          tokens on request, to delete tokens when they've finished being used
          or to enable the sharing of such tokens between users to allow shared
          access to result sets. No best practice guidelines are currently available
          for such models, but any interested parties are asked to bring up their
          requirements on the SRU mailing list so that some may be drafted.
        <p>The URI for the namespace for this extension is <strong>info:srw/extension/2/auth-1.0 </strong>          <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
