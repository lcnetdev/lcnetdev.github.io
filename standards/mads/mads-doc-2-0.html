      <h1>MADS 2.0 - XML Format for Authorities Data (May, 2011)</h1>
      <p>MADS is a MARC21-compatible XML format for the type of data carried 
      in the MARC 21 Authority format. An individual MADS description consists of at least one main &lt;authority&gt; element and any number of additional main elements: &lt;authority&gt;, &lt;related&gt;, and/or &lt;variant&gt;. Each of these main elements contains one or more of the following descriptor subelements:  &lt;name&gt;, &lt;titleInfo&gt;, &lt;topic&gt;, &lt;temporal&gt;, &lt;genre&gt;, &lt;geographic&gt;, &lt;hierarchicalGeographic&gt;, &lt;occupation&gt;. One or more  descriptor subelements may be combined within an &lt;authority&gt; element
        to control an authoritative heading that consists of multiple parts, for example, name/title headings and subject strings with various components (e.g. &lt;topic&gt; and &lt;geographic&gt;). 
	 MADS main elements (containing descriptor subelements) are then supplemented by any number of minor elements.</p>
      <p> At a higher level, the &lt;madsCollection&gt; root element is used to contain a group of MADS descriptions, while  the &lt;mads&gt; root element is used to contain main and minor elements within an individual MADS description.</p>
      <p>This document does not include descriptions of all MADS elements and attributes. Please see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mads/mads-outline-2-0.html">Outline of Elements and Attributes in MADS 2.0</a> for a comprehensive list. </p>
      <h2><u>Root Elements</u></h2>
            <h3><strong>&lt;madsCollection&gt;</strong></h3>
        <dd>
        <p>The &lt;madsCollection&gt; element contains a group of MADS descriptions.        </dd>
		
        <h3><strong>&lt;mads&gt;</strong></h3>
        <dd>
          <p>The &lt;mads&gt; element  contains an individual MADS description.</p>
        </dd>
		     <h2><u>Main Elements</u></h2>
	         <h3><strong>&lt;authority&gt;</strong></h3>
        <dd>
          <p>The &lt;authority&gt; element is a container that includes a standardized &quot;authoritative&quot; form of an agent (person or organization), an event, a title, or a term (topic, genre, geographic). The authority container may only be repeated to give multiple authoritative forms in different languages or scripts</p>
          <p>The geographicSubdivision attribute can be used with the &lt;authority&gt; element to indicate whether or not a concept can append a geographic facet, such as the name of a country or other jurisdiction, region, or geographic feature. This information is important to some controlled vocabularies, such as   LCSH. For vocabularies to which this does not apply, the attribute would not be used. The geographicSubdivision attribute is comparable to MARC Authority 008/06, and can carry the following values: </p>
        </dd>
		<dd>
          <p><strong>none - </strong>no geographic facet applies<br>
            <strong>direct - </strong>a geographic facet may be applied without its larger geographic entity<br>
            <strong>indirect - </strong>a geographic facet may be applied with the name of its larger geographic entity<br>
            <strong>not applicable - </strong>a geographic facet is not appropriate<br>
            </p>
        </dd>
		
        <h3><strong>&lt;related&gt;</strong></h3>
        <dd>
          <p>The &lt;related&gt; element includes a name or term that has
            some relation to the authoritative form. It is not a variant because it
            is a legitimate, authoritative heading on its own. These are equivalent
            to &quot;see also&quot; references in library catalogs. The type attribute
            designates the type of relationship, using the following values:</p>
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>earlier </strong>- used for the earlier form of a name, especially
            corporate bodies that have changed name over time.<br>
            <strong>later - </strong>used for the later form of a name, especially
            corporate bodies that have changed name over time. <br>
            <strong>parentOrg </strong>- this is a name heading that gives the
            parent organization of a corporate name heading. There can be more
            than one parent organization reference on a record, as in the case
            of jointly held corporations. <br>
            <strong>broader - </strong>this type of reference is for subject authorities,
            and indicates a hierarchical relationship between two headings.<br>
            <strong>narrower - </strong>this related reference also indicates a
            hierarchical relationship between subject headings. There may be many
            narrower headings in a record. <br>
            <strong>equivalent </strong>- a heading which is equivalent to one
            in another catalog or thesaurus<br>
            <strong>other</strong> - used for a variant that does not have a specified related
            type. This should be used with an unspecified type of relationship
            or a general see also reference. <br>
            <strong>otherType</strong>
            - used for any other specified type of variant that is not enumerated in the schema. <br> 
          </p>
        </dd>
     
      <h3><strong>&lt;variant&gt;</strong></h3>
        <dd>
          <p>The &lt;variant&gt; element includes a reference such as 
            a name or term that is not considered the
            authoritative form.
            For example,
            if the person's authoritative name is John J. Jones, but he is sometimes
            referred to as J.J. Jones, then J.J. Jones can be entered as a name reference
            under &lt;variant&gt;. In library catalogs, variant headings are only used
            as &quot;see&quot; references
            and are not used on the catalog's bibliographic, but
            lead users to
            the correct
            heading.
            The type attribute designates the type of variant, using the following values:</p>
        </dd>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>acronym - </strong>an acronym which is considered a variant of the
            name in &lt;authority&gt;. Used most frequently for corporate names.
            Corresponds to MARC Authority 4XX $w/0, value &quot;d&quot;.<br>
            <strong>abbreviation - </strong>abbreviation generally applies to titles,
            when an abbreviation may be used for indexing or identification. It
            does not have an equivalent in the MARC Authority format, but relates
            to the field 210 in the MARC Bibliographic format.<br>
            <strong>translation - </strong>a variant which is a translation of the
            authoritative name or title. These are not distuinguished from other references
            in the MARC Authority record.<br>
            <strong>expansion </strong>- an expanded form of the name in &lt;authority&gt;.<br>
            <strong>other</strong> - a variant that does not have a specified
            variant type.<br>
			<strong>otherType</strong>
            - a variant that has any other specified variant type that is not enumerated in the schema. <br>
			<strong>hidden</strong>
            - used for a variant form that is not  displayed (for   instance because it is offensive), with the single allowed value "yes". Corresponds to MARC 4XX $w/3 code "a": Reference not displayed. <br>
          </p>
        </dd>

          names.  It

      <p>&lt;affiliation&gt; allows for encoding the full affiliation
        and contact information for a person or organization, including position,
        organization name, address, phone and fax numbers, email
        address, and a date that the contact information was valid. It can be

        of competence of a person or organization. It is equivalent to MARC Authority  field 372.</p>
	<h3>&lt;identifier&gt;</h3>
      <p>&lt;identifier&gt; includes an identifier associated with the entity described in
        the record. The type attribute specifies the identifier scheme, which is an
        uncontrolled
        list. An example of an identifier type appropriate for a MADS record is &quot;istc&quot;. It is equivalent to MARC Authority  fields 010, 016, 020, 022, 024, 035. </p>
			<h3>&lt;language&gt;</h3>
